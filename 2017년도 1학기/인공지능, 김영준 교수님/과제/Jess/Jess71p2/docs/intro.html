<h3>1.1. Requirements</h3>
</a>


<p>Jess is a programmer's library written in Java. Therefore, to use
Jess, you'll need a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). You can get an
excellent JVM for Windows, Linux, and Solaris free from <a href="http://java.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a>. Jess 7.1 is
compatible with all released versions of Java starting with JDK 1.4,
including JDK 1.6, the latest release. Older Jess versions numbered
4.x were compatible with JDK 1.0, 5.x versions worked with JDK 1.1,
and Jess 6 worked with JDK 1.2 and up.</p>


<p>Be sure your JVM is installed and working correctly before trying
to use Jess.
</p>


<p>To use the JessDE integrated development environment, you'll need
version 3.1 or later of the Eclipse SDK from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">http://www.eclipse.org</a>. Be sure
that Eclipse is installed and working properly before installing the
JessDE.
</p>


<p>The Jess library serves as an interpreter for another language,
which I will refer to in this document as the Jess language. The Jess
language is a highly specialized form of Lisp.</p>


<p>I am going to assume that you, the reader, are a programmer who
will be using either one or both of these languages. I will assume
that all readers have at least a minimal facility with Java. You must
have a Java runtime system, and you must know how to use it at least
in a simple way. You should know how to use it to</p>


<ul>
    
<li>run a Java application</li>
    
<li>deal with configuration issues like the CLASSPATH variable</li>
    
<li>(optional) compile a collection of Java source files</li>

</ul>


<p>If you do not have at least this passing familiarity with a Java
environment, then may I suggest you purchase an introductory book on
the topic. Java software for many platforms -- as well as a wealth of
tutorials and documentation -- is available at no cost from <a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
For those readers who are going to program in the Jess language, I
assume general familiarity with the principles of programming. I will
describe the entire Jess language, so no familiarity with Lisp is
required (although some is helpful.) Furthermore, I will attempt to
describe, to the extent possible, the important concepts of rule-based
systems as they apply to Jess. Again, though, I will assume that the
reader has some familiarity with these concepts and more. If you are
unfamiliar with rule-based systems, you may want to purchase a text on
this topic as well.
</p>

<p>
Many readers will want to extend Jess' capabilities by either adding
commands (written in Java) to the Jess language, or embedding the
Jess library in a Java application. Others will want to use the Jess
language's Java integration capabilities to call Java functions from
Jess language programs. In sections of this document targeted towards
these readers, I will assume moderate knowledge of Java programming. I
will not teach any aspects of the Java language. The interested reader
is once again referred to your local bookstore.

<a name="setup">
<h3>1.2. Getting ready</h3>
</a>

<a name="unpacking">
<h4>1.2.1. Unpacking the Distribution</h4>
</a>

Jess is supplied as a single .zip file which can be used on all
supported platforms. This single file contains all you need to use
Jess on Windows, UNIX, or the Macintosh (except for a JVM, which you
must install yourself.)

<p></p>

When Jess is unpacked, you should have a directory named
<tt>Jess71p2/</tt>.  Inside this directory should be the
following files and subdirectories: <p></p>

<table ncols="2" border="">

    
<tr>
      
<td><tt>README</tt></td>
      <td>A quick start guide.</td>
    
</tr>

    
<tr>
        
<td><tt>LICENSE</tt></td>
        <td>Information about your rights regarding the use of Jess.</td>
    
</tr>

    
<tr>
        
<td><tt>bin</tt></td> <td>A directory containing a Windows
        batch file (jess.bat) and a UNIX shell script (jess) that you
        can use to start the Jess command prompt.</td>
    
</tr>

    
<tr>
        
<td><tt>lib</tt></td>
        <td>A directory containing Jess itself, as a Java archive
        file. Note that this is <i>not</i> a "clickable" archive file;
        you can't double-click on it to run Jess. This is
        deliberate. This directory also contains the JSR-94
        (javax.rules) API in the file jsr94.jar.</td>
    
</tr>

    
<tr>
        
<td><tt>docs/</tt></td>
        <td>This documentation. "index.html" is the entry point for
        the Jess manual.</td>

<h4>1.2.2. Command-line Interface</h4>
</a>
Jess has an interactive command-line interface. The distribution
includes two scripts that you can run to get a Jess command prompt:
one for Windows, and one for UNIX. They're both in the bin/
directory. Run the one that's appropriate for your system, and you
should see something like this

<div class="example">
<pre>
C:\Jess71p2&gt; bin\jess.bat

Jess, the Rule Engine for the Java Platform
Copyright (C) 2008 Sandia Corporation
Jess Version 7.1p1 8/6/2008

<b>Jess&gt;</b>

</pre>
</div>

That's the Jess prompt. Try evaluating a prefix math expression like
"(+ 2 2)". Don't forget those parentheses!

<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(+ 2 2)</pre>

<pre>
<i>4</i>
</pre>

</div>

Jess evaluates this function, and prints the result. In the next
        chapter of this manual, we'll look at the syntax of the Jess
        rule language itself.

<p></p>

To execute a file of Jess code from the Jess prompt, use
the <a href="functions.html#batch"><tt>batch</tt></a> command:

<div class="example">
<pre>

<b>Jess&gt;</b> (batch "examples/jess/sticks.clp")
Who moves first (Computer: c Human: h)?
</pre>
</div>

Note that in the preceding example, you type what follows the
<tt>Jess&gt;</tt> prompt, and Jess responds with the text on the next line. I will
follow this convention throughout this manual.
<p></p>

To execute the same Jess program directly from the operating-system
prompt, you can pass the name of the program as an argument to the
script that starts Jess:

<div class="example">
<pre>
C:\Jess71p2&gt; bin\jess.bat examples\jess\sticks.clp

Jess, the Rule Engine for the Java Platform
Copyright (C) 2008 Sandia Corporation
Jess Version 7.1p1 8/6/2008

Who moves first (Computer: c Human: h)?
</pre>
</div>


<a name="jline">
<h5>1.2.2.1. Command-line editing</h5>
</a>

<p>When working at the Jess command line, it's convenient to be able to edit
and reinvoke previous commands. The Jess library doesn't support this directly, but the excellent
open-source product <a href="http://jline.sourceforge.net/">JLine</a> can add this capability to any
command-line Java program, Jess included. JLine works great with the Jess prompt and
I strongly recommend it.
</p>





<a name="console">
<h5>1.2.2.2. Graphical console</h5>
</a>
The class <tt>jess.Console</tt> is a simple graphical version of the
Jess command-line interface. You type into a text field at the bottom
of the window, and output appears in a scrolling window above. Type

<div class="example">
<pre>
C:\Jess71p2&gt; java -classpath lib\jess.jar jess.Console
</pre>
</div>

from the Jess71p2 directory to try it.




<a name="installing">
<h4>1.2.3. Java Programming with Jess</h4>
</a>
    To use Jess as a library from your Java programs, the file
    <tt>jess.jar</tt> (in the lib directory) must either be on your
    class path, be installed as a standard extension, or your
    development tools must be set up to recognize it.  The details of
    doing these tasks are system and environment dependent, but
    setting the class path usually involves modifying an environment
    variable, and installing a standard extension simply means copying
    <tt>jess.jar</tt> into your <tt>$(JAVA_HOME)/jre/lib/ext</tt>
    directory. Refer to the Java documentation or an introductory Java
    text for details.


<a name="examples">
<h4>1.2.4. Jess Example Programs</h4>
</a>

There are some simple example programs (in the examples/jess and
examples/xml directories) that you can use to test that you have
installed Jess properly. These include <tt>fullmab.clp</tt>,
<tt>zebra.clp</tt>, and <tt>wordgame.clp</tt>. <tt>fullmab.clp</tt> is
a version of the classic Monkey and Bananas problem. To run it
yourself from the command line, just type:

<div class="example">
<pre>
C:\Jess71p2&gt; bin\jess examples\jess\fullmab.clp
</pre>
</div>

and the problem should run, producing a few screens of output. Any
file of Jess code can be run this way. Giving Jess a file name on the
command line is like using the <a href="functions.html#batch"><tt>batch</tt></a>
function. Therefore, you generally need to make sure that the file ends
with:

<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(reset)
(run)</pre>

</div>

or no rules will fire. The <tt>zebra.clp</tt> and
<tt>wordgame.clp</tt> programs are two classic examples selected to
show how Jess deals with tough situations. These examples both
generate large numbers of partial pattern matches, so they are slow
and use up a lot of memory. Other examples include <tt>sticks.clp</tt>
(an interactive game) and <tt>jframe.clp</tt> (a demo of building a
graphical interface using Jess's Java integration capabilities).  <p></p>

The XML examples are in individual subdirectories; each subdirectory
contains a README file with instructions for running that example.
