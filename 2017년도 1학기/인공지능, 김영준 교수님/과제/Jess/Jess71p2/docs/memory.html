<h2>5.
        Working Memory</h2>
    


<p>
Each Jess rule engine holds a collection of knowledge nuggets called
<i>facts.</i> This collection is known as the <i>working memory.</i>
Working memory is important because <a href="rules.html">rules</a> can only react to additions, deletions,
and changes to working memory. You can't write a Jess rule that will
react to anything else.
</p>

<p>
Some facts are <i>pure facts</i> defined and created entirely by
Jess. Other facts are <a href="#shadow_facts"><i>shadow facts</i></a>
connected to Java objects you provide. Shadow facts act as "bridges"
that let Jess reason about things that happen outside of working
memory.
</p>


<p>
Every fact has a <i>template</i>. The template has a name and a set of
<i>slots</i>, and each fact gets these things from its template. This
is the same structure that JavaBeans -- plain old Java objects, or
POJOs -- have, and it's also similar to how relational databases are
set up. The template is like the class of a Java object, or like a
relational database table. The slots are like the properties of the
JavaBean, or the columns of a table. A fact is therefore like a single
JavaBean, or like a row in a database table. You can think of it
either way. </p>


<p>
In Jess, there are three kinds of facts: <i>unordered facts</i>,
<i>shadow facts</i> and <i>ordered facts</i>. We'll learn about all of
these in this chapter. First, though, we need to learn
more about templates.</p>


<p>
Just so you know, as we learn about working memory: you can see a list
of all the facts in working memory using the <a href="functions.html#facts"><tt>facts</tt></a>
command. Facts are added using the <a href="functions.html#assert"><tt>assert</tt></a>, <a href="functions.html#add"><tt>add</tt></a>, and <a href="functions.html#definstance"><tt>definstance</tt></a> functions. You can
remove facts with the <a href="functions.html#retract"><tt>retract</tt></a> and <a href="functions.html#undefinstance"><tt>undefinstance</tt></a> functions. The <a href="functions.html#modify"><tt>modify</tt></a> function
lets you change the slot values of facts already in working
memory. And finally, you can completely clear Jess of all facts and
other data using the <a href="functions.html#clear"><tt>clear</tt></a> command.</p>



<a name="templates">
<h3>5.1. Templates</h3>
</a>

<p>As we've already stated, every fact has a <i>template</i>. A fact
gets its <i>name</i> and its list of <i>slots</i> from its
template. Therefore a template is something like a Java class.</p>


<p>You usually create templates yourself using the <a href="constructs.html#deftemplate"><tt>deftemplate</tt></a> construct or the <a href="functions.html#defclass"><tt>defclass</tt></a>
function. Other times, templates are created automatically for you,
either while you're defining a <a href="constructs.html#defrule"><tt>defrule</tt></a> or when you
use the <a href="functions.html#add"><tt>add</tt></a> function or the <a href="api/jess/Rete.html#add(java.lang.Object)"><tt><tt>jess.Rete.</tt>add(java.lang.Object)</tt></a> method.</p>


<p>The deftemplate construct is the most general and most powerful way
to create a template. You won't understand most of the options shown
here yet, but we'll cover them all in this chapter and the next:</p>


<div class="example">
<pre>
(deftemplate <i>template-name</i>
    [extends <i>template-name</i>]
    ["Documentation comment"]
    [(declare  (slot-specific TRUE | <b>FALSE</b>)
               (backchain-reactive TRUE | <b>FALSE</b>)
               (from-class <i>class name</i>)
               (include-variables TRUE | <b>FALSE</b>)
               (ordered TRUE | <b>FALSE</b>))]
     (slot | multislot <i>slot-name</i>
         ([(type <b>ANY</b> | INTEGER | FLOAT |
                NUMBER | SYMBOL | STRING |
                LEXEME | OBJECT | LONG)]
         [(default <i>default value</i>)]
         [(default-dynamic <i>expression</i>)]
         [(allowed-values <i>expression</i>+)])*)
</pre>
</div>


<p>A template declaration includes a name, an optional documentation
string, an optional "extends" clause, an optional list of
declarations, and a list of zero or more slot descriptions. Each slot
description can optionally include a type qualifier or a default value
qualifier. In the syntax diagram, defaults for various options are
indicated in bold letters.</p>


<p>The <i>template-name</i> is the head of the facts that will be created
using this template.</p>


<p>The declarations affect either how the template will be created, or
how facts that use it will act, or both. We'll cover most of the
declarations in this chapter; others are covered in the <a href="constructs.html">Constructs</a> appendix or in the <a href="rules.html">chapter on rules.</a>
</p>


<p>Every template has a single parent template, which can be specified
with the "extends" clause. A template inherits all the slots of its
parent template, as well as declared properties
  like <tt>slot-specific</tt> and <tt>backchain-reactive</tt>. If you don't
specify a parent, a template extends a template named "__fact", which
has no slots.</p>
        

<p>Some template declarations include <i>slots</i> (those that don't
will generally have implicitly defined slots.) There may
be an arbitrary number of slots in a template. Each
<i>&lt;slot-name&gt;</i> must be a symbol. A <i>multislot</i> is a slot
    that can hold a list of values, while a normal slot can hold just one
    value at a time. The name of a slot may <i>not</i> contain a '.'
    (dot) character.</p>


<p>Each slot can have a list of zero or more <i>slot qualifiers.</i>
    The <tt>default</tt> slot qualifier gives a value to use for a
    slot when the fact is first created, if no other value is specified;
    the default is the symbol <tt>nil</tt> for a regular slot, and
    the empty list for a multislot.
<tt>default-dynamic</tt> is similar but the the given
<i>expression</i> will be evaluated each time a new fact using this template is
asserted.</p>

    
<p>The <tt>type</tt> slot qualifier is accepted but not
currently enforced by Jess; in theory it specifies what data type the slot is
allowed to hold. Acceptable values are ANY, INTEGER, FLOAT, NUMBER,
SYMBOL, STRING, LEXEME, and OBJECT.</p>

    
<p>The <tt>allowed-values</tt> slot qualifier gives a set of values allowed
        to be in the slot. For a multislot, the allowed values are restricted to values
    in this set. If you specify both <tt>allowed-values</tt> and <tt>default</tt>, Jess checks
    to make sure they're consistent. If you specify <tt>allowed-values</tt> but do not specify
    a slot default, then the first listed allowed value becomes the default.</p>


<a name="undefining_templates">
<h4>5.1.1. Undefining templates</h4>
</a>
    
<p>Although it shouldn't be a  common requirement, you can remove a previously defined template using the
        <a href="api/jess/Rete.html#removeDeftemplate(String)"><tt><tt>jess.Rete.</tt>removeDeftemplate(String)</tt></a> method. You might want to do this during interactive
    development, because you can't change the slots of a template without removing the old definition first. You won't be
        able to remove a template unless it's completely unused: no rules, other templates, deffacts, or facts may reference it. </p>





<a name="unordered_facts">
<h3>5.2. Unordered facts</h3>
</a>


<p>In object-oriented languages like Java, <i>objects</i> have named
<i>fields</i> in which data appears. Unordered facts offer this
capability (although the fields are traditionally called
<i>slots.</i>)</p>


<div class="example">
<pre>
(automobile (make Ford) (model Explorer) (year 1999))
</pre>
</div>


<p>Before you can create unordered facts, you have to define the slots
they have using the <a href="constructs.html#deftemplate"><tt>deftemplate</tt></a> construct. </p>


<p>As an example, defining the following template:</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(deftemplate automobile
  "A specific car."
  (slot make)
  (slot model)
  (slot year (type INTEGER))
  (slot color (default white)))</pre>

</div>


<p>would allow you to define the fact shown here.  </p>



<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(reset)</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(assert (automobile (model LeBaron) (make Chrysler)
        (year 1997)))</pre>

<pre>
<i>&lt;Fact-1&gt;</i>
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(facts)</pre>

<pre>
<i>
f-0   (MAIN::initial-fact)
f-1   (MAIN::automobile (make Chrysler) (model LeBaron)
                        (year 1997) (color white))
For a total of 2 facts in module MAIN.</i>
</pre>

</div>


<p>Note that the car is white by default. If you don't supply a default
value for a slot, and then don't supply a value when a fact is
asserted, the special value <tt>nil</tt> is used. Also note that any
number of additional automobiles could also be simultaneously asserted
onto the fact list using this template.</p>


<p>Note also that we can specify the slots of an unordered fact in any order
(hence the name.) Jess rearranges our inputs into a <i>canonical
order</i> so that they're always the same.</p>


<p>As you can see above, each fact is assigned an integer index (the
<i>fact-id</i>) when it is asserted. You can remove an individual fact
from the working memory using the <a href="functions.html#retract"><tt>retract</tt></a> function.</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(retract 1)</pre>

<pre>
<i>TRUE</i>
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(facts)</pre>

<pre>
<i>f-0   (MAIN::initial-fact)
For a total of 1 facts in module MAIN.</i>
</pre>

</div>


<p>The fact <tt>(initial-fact)</tt> is asserted by the <a href="functions.html#reset"><tt>reset</tt></a>
command. It is used internally by Jess to keep track of its own
operations; you should generally not retract it.</p>


<p>A given slot in a deftemplate fact can normally hold only one
value. If you want a slot that can hold multiple values, use the <tt>multislot</tt>
keyword instead:</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(deftemplate box (slot location) (multislot contents))</pre>

<pre>
<i>TRUE</i>
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(bind ?id (assert (box (location kitchen)
                       (contents spatula sponge frying-pan))))</pre>

<pre>
<i>&lt;Fact-2&gt;</i>
</pre>

</div>


<p>(We're saving the fact returned by (assert) in the variable ?id,
for use below.) A multislot has the default value () (the empty list) if no other
default is specified.</p>


<p>You can change the values in the slots of an unordered fact using the
<a href="functions.html#modify"><tt>modify</tt></a> command. Building on the immediately preceding
example, we can move the box into the dining room:</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(modify ?id (location dining-room))</pre>

<pre>
<i>&lt;Fact-2&gt;</i>
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(facts)</pre>

<pre>
<i>f-0   (MAIN::initial-fact)
f-2   (MAIN::box (location dining-room)
                 (contents spatula sponge frying-pan))
For a total of 2 facts in module MAIN.</i>
</pre>

</div>
            
<p></p>


<p>The optional <tt>extends</tt> clause of the <tt>deftemplate</tt>
construct lets you define one template in terms of
another. For example, you could define a used-auto as a kind of automobile
with more data:</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(deftemplate used-auto extends automobile
  (slot mileage)
  (slot blue-book-value)
  (multislot owners))</pre>

<pre>
<i>TRUE</i>
</pre>

</div>


<p>A used-auto fact would now have all the slots of an automobile, in
the same order, plus three more. As we'll see later, this inheritance
relationship will let you act on all automobiles (used or not) when
you so desire, or only on the used ones.</p>



<a name="shadow_facts">
<h3>5.3. Shadow facts: reasoning about Java objects</h3>
</a>


<p>As mentioned previously, shadow facts are just unordered facts that
serve as "bridges" to Java objects. By using shadow facts, you can put
any Java object into Jess's working memory.</p>


<a name="shadow_templates">
<h4>5.3.1. Templates for shadow facts</h4>
</a>

<p>Like all other facts, shadow facts need to have a template, In this
case, though, rather than specifying the slots ourselves, we want to
let Jess create the template automatically by looking at a Java
class. For example, we might be writing a banking program. Our
imaginary Java code works with <tt>Account</tt> objects, like this:</p>


<div class="javacode">
<pre>

import java.io.Serializable;

public class Account implements Serializable {
    private float balance;
    public float getBalance() { return balance; }
    public void setBalance(float balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }
    // Other, more interesting methods
}

</pre>
</div>


<p> At some point the rule-based part of our program needs to deal
with these too.  Therefore we'll need a template like this:</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(deftemplate Account
    (declare (from-class Account)))
</pre>

</div>


<p>Note how I've used the class name (minus the package prefix, if
there was one) as the template name. This is just a convention, and
the template name can be anything you want. But as we'll see a little
later, Jess knows about this convention and using it can save a little
work.</p>


<p>This template will automatically have slots corresponding to the
the JavaBeans properties of the <tt>Account</tt> class: in particular,
there will be a slot named <tt>balance</tt> corresponding to the
<tt>getBalance()</tt> method. Jess uses the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/beans/Introspector.html"><tt>java.beans.Introspector</tt></a> class to find the property names, so
you can customize how Jess defines properties by writing your own
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/beans/BeanInfo.html"><tt>java.beans.BeanInfo</tt></a> classes.</p>


<p>The <a href="functions.html#defclass"><tt>defclass</tt></a> function can be used instead to create a
shadow fact template; it looks like</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(defclass Account Account)</pre>

</div>


<p>It is just a shortcut for using deftemplate. The chief advantage of
<a href="functions.html#defclass"><tt>defclass</tt></a> is that because it is a function, it can be
used anywhere, unlike <a href="constructs.html#deftemplate"><tt>deftemplate</tt></a> which is a
construct, and can only be used at the top level of a program (see
<a href="constructs.html">here</a> for more information.) The
chief disadvantage is that it is limited in what it can do: many of
the declarables that are available with <tt>deftemplate</tt> are not
available with <tt>defclass</tt>.</p>


<p>The <tt>from-class</tt> declaration, by itself, will create slots
that correspond to JavaBeans properties. If you also use <tt>include-variables</tt>, like this:</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(deftemplate Account
    (declare (from-class Account)
             (include-variables TRUE))</pre>

</div>


<p>then public member variables of the class are used to define additional slots.</p>



<a name="shadow_instances">
<h4>5.3.2. Adding Java objects to working memory</h4>
</a>


<p>Once you've created an appropriate template, you can add some Java
objects to working memory, automatically creating shadow facts to link
them to Jess. Continuing with our <tt>Account</tt> example, imagine
that you want to create an <tt>Account</tt>, and you want to add this
object to working memory because rules will be working with it. Then
all you need to do is:</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(bind ?a (new Account))</pre>

<pre>
<i>&lt;Java-Object:Account&gt;</i>
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(add ?a)</pre>

<pre>
<i>&lt;Fact-0&gt;</i>
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(facts)</pre>

<pre>
<i>f-0   (MAIN::Account
             (balance 0.0)
             (class &lt;Java-Object:java.lang.Class&gt;)
             (OBJECT &lt;Java-Object:Account&gt;))
For a total of 1 facts in module MAIN.</i>
</pre>

</div>


<p>The <a href="functions.html#add"><tt>add</tt></a> function creates a shadow fact and links it
to our <tt>Account</tt> object. We'll explore the nature of that link in
the following section, but before we do that, I want to point out two
things about <a href="functions.html#add"><tt>add</tt></a> and about shadow fact templates in
general.</p>


<p>First, note that the template has a slot named <tt>OBJECT</tt>. All
shadow fact templates have this slot. Each shadow fact created from
this template will use that slot to hold a reference to the Java
object itself. Therefore, the original object is always easily
available. The reverse mapping (given a Java object, finding its
shadow fact) is also available using the method <a href="api/jess/Rete.html#getShadowFactForObject(java.lang.Object)"><tt><tt>jess.Rete.</tt>getShadowFactForObject(java.lang.Object)</tt></a>.</p>


<p>Second, the <a href="functions.html#add"><tt>add</tt></a> function understands the template
naming convention discussed in the previous section. If you call
<a href="functions.html#add"><tt>add</tt></a> without creating a matching template first, <a href="functions.html#add"><tt>add</tt></a> will create a template automatically, using that naming
convention.</p>




<a name="property_change_events">
<h4>5.3.3. Responding to changes</h4>
</a>


<p>Continuing with our <tt>Account</tt> example, we can use the <a href="functions.html#modify"><tt>modify</tt></a> function to change the fact, and the Java object will
be automatically modified too:</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(printout t (?a getBalance) crlf)</pre>

<pre>
<i>0.0</i>
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(modify 0 (balance 1))</pre>

<pre>
<i>&lt;Fact-0&gt;</i>
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(facts)</pre>

<pre>
<i>f-0   (MAIN::Account
                   (balance 1)
                   (class &lt;Java-Object:java.lang.Class&gt;)
                   (OBJECT &lt;Java-Object:Account&gt;))
For a total of 1 facts in module MAIN.</i>
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(printout t (?a getBalance) crlf)</pre>

<pre>
<i>1.0</i>
</pre>

</div>



<p>But what happens if we modify the <tt>Account</tt> directly?</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(printout t (?a getBalance) crlf)</pre>

<pre>
<i>1.0</i>
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(?a setBalance 2)</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(printout t (?a getBalance) crlf)</pre>

<pre>
<i>2.0</i>
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(facts)</pre>

<pre>
<i>f-0   (MAIN::Account
             (balance 1)
             (class &lt;Java-Object:java.lang.Class&gt;)
             (OBJECT &lt;Java-Object:Account&gt;))
For a total of 1 facts in module MAIN.</i>
</pre>

</div>


<p>The working memory still thinks our Account's balance is
1.0. There are several ways to notify Jess that the object is changed
and working memory needs updating. One is using the <a href="functions.html#update"><tt>update</tt></a> function:</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(update ?a)</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(facts)</pre>

<pre>
<i>f-0   (MAIN::Account
             (balance 2.0)
             (class &lt;Java-Object:java.lang.Class&gt;)
             (OBJECT &lt;Java-Object:Account&gt;))
For a total of 1 facts in module MAIN.</i>
</pre>

</div>


<p> 
<a href="functions.html#update"><tt>update</tt></a> tells Jess to refresh the slot values of
the shadow fact linked to the given Java object. The <a href="functions.html#reset"><tt>reset</tt></a> function, which resets working memory, updates the
slots of <i>all</i> shadow facts in the process.  You can also
actively tell Jess to refresh its knowledge of the properties of
individual objects using the <a href="api/jess/Rete.html#updateObject(java.lang.Object)"><tt><tt>jess.Rete.</tt>updateObject(java.lang.Object)</tt></a> method.</p>


<p>This behaviour is what you get for objects that don't support
<i>property change notification.</i> In practice, this is fine. Most
rule-based programs reason about static "value" objects whose
properties don't change over time, or change only occasionally or at
well-defined times.</p>


<p>But if your objects will be changed often from outside of Jess,
then it would be nice to have updates happen automatically. If you want to
have your shadow facts stay continuously up to date, Jess needs to be
notified whenever a Bean property changes. For this to happen, the
Bean has to support the use of <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyChangeListener.html"><tt>java.beans.PropertyChangeListener</tt></a>s. For Beans that fulfill
this requirement Jess will automatically arrange for working memory to
be updated every time a property of the Bean changes. We can modify
our Account class to support this feature like this:</p>


<div class="javacode">
<pre>

import java.io.Serializable;
import java.beans.*;

import java.io.Serializable;

public class PCSAccount implements Serializable {
    private PropertyChangeSupport pcs = new PropertyChangeSupport(this);
    private float balance;
    public float getBalance() { return balance; }
    public void setBalance(float balance) {
        float temp = this.balance;
        this.balance = balance;
        pcs.firePropertyChange("balance", new Float(temp), new Float(balance));
    }
    public void addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener pcl) {
        pcs.addPropertyChangeListener(pcl);
    }
    public void removePropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener pcl) {
        pcs.removePropertyChangeListener(pcl);
    }
    // Other, more interesting methods
}

</pre>
</div>


<p>Now whenever an Account balance is modified, Jess will be notified
and the corresponding shadow fact will be updated immediately.</p>




<a name="more_property_change">
<h4>5.3.4. More about PropertyChangeEvents</h4>
</a>
    
<p>
       PropertyChangeEvents and shadow facts seem magical to some people; the flow of control
       can be confusing, and the notion of things happening "automatically" sometimes makes people
       forget that no code executes in Java unless something, somewhere, invokes it.
       They're not magical, and to prove it, I'll explain exactly where they come from, what they do,
       and what Jess does when it sees one -- or not.
    </p>

    
<p>
        First, have a look back at the PCSAccount class above. It's a classic example of a JavaBean that
        supports PropertyChangeListeners. When you add an instance of this class to working memory, Jess
        will <i>usually</i> call <tt>addPropertyChangeListener(listener)</tt> on it, where <i>listener</i> is a
        Jess object designed to respond to change events. The listener object is
        added to a list of objects that want to be notified when the PCSAccount object's properties change. This list
        is managed by the <tt>PropertyChangeSupport</tt> object that the PCSAccount holds as a member (Why "usually?"
        If you use <a href="functions.html#definstance"><tt>definstance</tt></a> to add the object to working memory and specify <tt>static</tt> as the
        final argument, then Jess will skip this step.)
    </p>

    
<p>
        Of course, many (most) Java classes <i>don't</i> allow you to add PropertyChangeListeners to them,
        and so for many of the Java objects you'll add to working memory, Jess doesn't register itself with
        the object in any way. The object is filed away in working memory, and that's it.
    </p>

    
<p>
        There are now two main scenarios of interest: an object in working memory can be modified from Jess code, or
        from Java code. Each of these scenarios can happen with or without PropertyChangeListeners, for a total of four
        cases. We'll discuss each of these four situations separately. The most important things to remember is that all of the
        steps discussed here happen synchronously: neither Jess, nor the <tt>PropertyChangeSupport</tt> class, will spawn any
        new threads to process change events. Everything happens on the thread that initiates the change. Now, on to the four cases:
    </p>

    
<ol>
    
<li>
        
<i>Object modified from Java, no PropertyChangeListeners.</i> In this case, the Java code modifies the object, and Jess
        doesn't know about it. Bad things may happen as a result: Jess's working memory indices may need to be updated.
        Therefore you should always call the
        <a href="api/jess/Rete.html#updateObject(java.lang.Object)"><tt><tt>jess.Rete.</tt>updateObject(java.lang.Object)</tt></a> method to tell Jess when an object is changed
        in this way.
    </li>

    
<li>
        
<i>Object modified from Java, PropertyChangeListeners.</i> In this case, Java code calls a method like <tt>setBalance()</tt>
        above, which calls <tt>firePropertyChange()</tt>, which iterates over that list of listeners we mentioned previously and calls
        <tt>propertyChanged()</tt> on each listener. One of those listeners will be the Jess object. Jess will examine
        the PropertyChangeEvent object that <tt>propertyChange()</tt> receives as an argument and update working memory appropriately.
    </li>

        
<li>
        
<i>Object modified from Jess, no PropertyChangeListeners.</i> If you use <a href="functions.html#modify"><tt>modify</tt></a> (or the Java equivalent)
           to modify a shadow fact, then Jess will call the appropriate "setter" methods on the object, and update working memory.
        </li>


        
<li>
        
<i>Object modified from Jess, PropertyChangeListeners.</i> This is the most complicated case. Note that there is a problem:
            if Jess calls a setter method on the object, then the object will send a redundant <tt>PropertyChangeEvent</tt> back to Jess.
            Unless Jess is careful, there could be an infinite loop. What Jess does is to call the setter methods, and then rely on the
            object to send a <tt>PropertyChangeEvent</tt> back. When Jess receives the change event, it will update working
            memory in response. This works fine as long as property change notification is implemented correctly by the object.
            If the object accepts <tt>PropertyChangeListeners</tt> but then doesn't send <tt>PropertyChangeEvents</tt>, however,
            then working memory will not be updated. If you have a class that behaves this way and you can't fix it, then you can always use <a href="functions.html#definstance"><tt>definstance</tt></a> with the <tt>static</tt> option so that Jess ignores the change support.
        </li>

    
</ol>

<h4>5.3.5. Shadow fact miscellany</h4>
</a>

        
<p>Shadow fact templates, like all templates, can
<tt>extend</tt> one another. In fact, shadow fact templates can extend
ordinary templates, and ordinary templates can extend shadow fact
templates. Of course, for a shadow fact template to extend a plain
template, the corresponding Java class must have property names that
match the plain template's slot names. Note, also, that just because
two Java classes have an inheritance relationship doesn't mean that
templates created from them will have the same relationship. You must
explicitly declare all such relationships using <tt>extends.</tt> See
the full documenation for <a href="constructs.html#deftemplate"><tt>deftemplate</tt></a> for details.
        </p>

        
<p>One final note about Java Beans used with Jess: Beans are often
        operating in a multithreaded environment, and so it's
        important to protect their data with synchronized blocks or
        synchronized methods. However, sending
        <tt>PropertyChangeEvents</tt> while holding a lock on the Bean
          itself can be dangerous, as the Java Beans Specification
          points out:</p>

        
<blockquote>
"In order to reduce the risk of deadlocks, we strongly recommend that
event sources should avoid holding their own internal locks when they
call event listener methods. Specifically, as in the example code in
Section 6.5.1, we recommend they should avoid using a synchronized
method to fire an event and should instead merely use a synchronized
block to locate the target listeners and then call the event listeners
from unsynchronized code." -- JavaBean Specification, v 1.0.1, p.31.
        </blockquote>
Failing to heed this advice can indeed cause deadlocks in Jess.

    

        <a name="ordered_facts">
<h3>5.4. Ordered facts</h3>
</a>

        
<p>Most of the time, you will use unordered facts (or their
            cousins, shadow facts.)  They are nicely structured, and
            they're the most efficient kind of fact in Jess. In some
            cases, though, slot names are redundant, and force you to
            do more typing than you'd like. For example, if a fact
            represents a single number, it seems silly to use an
            unordered fact like this:</p>


<div class="example">
<pre>
(number (value 6))
</pre>
</div>

            
<p>What you'd like would be a way to leave out that redundant "value" identifier.
                Ordered facts let you do exactly that.</p>
            Ordered facts are simply Jess lists, where the first field (the <i>head</i>
        of the list) acts as a sort of category for the fact. Here are some
        examples of ordered facts:

<div class="example">
<pre>
(shopping-list eggs milk bread)
(person "Bob Smith" Male 35)
(father-of danielle ejfried)
</pre>
</div>

        
<p>You can add ordered facts to the working memory using the
        <a href="functions.html#assert"><tt>assert</tt></a> function, just as with unordered facts.
        If you add a fact to working memory whose head hasn't been
        used before, Jess assumes you want it to be an ordered fact
        and creates an appropriate template
        automatically. Alternatively, you can explicitly declare an
        ordered template using the <tt>ordered</tt> declaration with
        the deftemplate construct:</p>

        
<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(deftemplate father-of
             "A directed association between a father and a child."
             (declare (ordered TRUE)))</pre>
        
</div>

        
<p>The quoted string is a <i>documentation comment</i>; you can use it to
        describe the template you're defining. Although declaring
        ordered templates this way is optional, it's good style to
        declare all your templates.</p>

            
<p>Note that an ordered fact is very similar to an unordered fact with
                only one multislot. The similarity is so strong, that
                in fact this is how ordered facts are implemented in Jess. If you
                assert an ordered fact, Jess automatically generates a template
                for it. This generated template will contain a single slot named
                "__data". Jess treats these facts specially - the name of the slot is
                normally hidden when the facts are displayed. This is really just a
                syntactic shorthand, though; ordered facts really are just unordered
                facts with a single multislot named "__data".</p>

    

        
<a name="deffacts">
<h3>5.5. The deffacts construct</h3>
</a>


<p>Typing separate <a href="functions.html#assert"><tt>assert</tt></a> commands for each of many facts is
rather tedious. To make life easier in this regard, Jess includes the
            <a href="constructs.html#deffacts"><tt>deffacts</tt></a> construct. A <tt>deffacts</tt> construct is a simply
a named list of facts. The facts in all defined <tt>deffacts</tt> are
asserted into the working memory whenever a <a href="functions.html#reset"><tt>reset</tt></a> command is
issued:</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(deffacts my-facts "Some useless facts"
  (foo bar)
  (bar foo))</pre>

<pre>
<i>TRUE</i>
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(reset)</pre>

<pre>
<i>TRUE</i>
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(facts)</pre>

<pre>
<i>f-0   (MAIN::initial-fact)
f-1   (MAIN::foo bar)
f-2   (MAIN::bar foo)
For a total of 3 facts in module MAIN.</i>
</pre>
