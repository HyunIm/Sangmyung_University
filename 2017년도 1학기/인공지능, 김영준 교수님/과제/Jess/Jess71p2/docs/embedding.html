<h2>11.
        Embedding Jess in a Java Application</h2>

        
<a name="intro">
<h3>11.1. Introduction</h3>
</a>
            
<p>In the first part of this chapter, we'll look at one way to embed Jess into a Java
                application. It's a <i>pricing engine</i> which determines the prices
                individual customers will pay for goods ordered through our e-commerce site. The
                material presented here will be easier to understand if you are familiar with
                <a href="library.html">Jess's Java APIs</a> and how to write
                <a href="rules.html">rules</a> in the Jess programming language.
            </p>
            
<p>
                At the end of this chapter, I'll talk about some general considerations that
                are useful when planning an application that embeds the Jess rule engine.
            </p>
        

        
<a name="motivation">
<h3>11.2. Motivation</h3>
</a>

            
<p>Imagine you're working on a pricing engine for online sales. The
                engine is supposed to look at each order, together with a customer's
                purchasing history, and apply various discounts and offers to the
                order. Imagine further that you've coded this up in a traditional Java
                class.</p>

            
<p>Your boss comes in, says, "Give a 10% discount to everybody who spends
                more than $100." Great. You add a single if-then statement, recompile,
                and you're back in business.</p>

            
<p>Boss comes in, says, "Give a 25% discount on items the
                customer buys three or more of." Another if-then, another recompile.</p>

            
<p>Boss comes in, says "Revoke 10% discount per-order, make it 10% if
                you spend $250 or more in one month. Also, if somebody buys a CD writer,
                send them a free sample of CD-RW disks; but only if they're a repeat
                customer. Oh, and by the way, we need to price shipping based on
                geographic zone, except for people with multiple locations..."</p>

            
<p>After a few weeks of this, if you've been using traditional
                programming techniques, your code is a gnarled mess -- and it's slow
                too, as it has to do all sorts of database queries for each order that
                comes in.</p>

            
<p>If you had written this using a rule engine, though, you'd have nice
                clean code, with one rule for each pricing policy. If somebody needed
                to know where the "Wacky Wednesday" pricing policy is implemented, it
                would be easy to find it.</p>

            
<p>And if that rule engine is a Jess-like system, it's not slow, either;
                the rule engine itself indexes all the orders and no lookups are
                required; the rule engine just "knows" what it needs to know about
                past orders.</p>


        
        
<a name="architecture">
<h3>11.3. Doing it with Jess</h3>
</a>

            
<p>
                So without further ado, we'll implement the above idea with Jess. We're going
                to write an explicit "pricing library" which can be invoked from a Web app or
                from any other kind of Java code. There will be both a Java component and a
                Jess language component to what we'll write; we'll look at the Java part first.
                Note that all the code for this example, including a test driver, comes with Jess;
                it's in the directory <tt>Jess71p2/examples/pricing_engine</tt>. There's a <tt>README</tt>
                file there with some information about building and running the example.
            </p>

            
<p>Your Java code needs to create an instance of the Jess rule engine, load in the
                catalog data, then load in the rules (which we'll be writing later in this chapter.)
                This one instance of Jess can then be reused to process each
                order. (You only have to load the catalog data once; Jess will index
                it and later accesses will be fast.) We'll package all this up in a class
                named <tt>PricingEngine</tt>:
            </p>


<div class="example">
<pre>
public class PricingEngine {
    private Rete engine;
    private WorkingMemoryMarker marker;
    private Database database;

    public PricingEngine(Database aDatabase) throws JessException {
        // Create a Jess rule engine
        engine = new Rete();
        engine.reset();

        // Load the pricing rules
        engine.batch("pricing.clp");

        // Load the catalog data into working memory
        database = aDatabase;
        engine.addAll(database.getCatalogItems());

       // Mark end of catalog data for later
       marker = engine.mark();
    }
</pre>
</div>

            
<p>(The <tt>Database</tt> interface is an application-specific data access wrapper;
                it's an interface and a trivial implementation is included in the
                example code.) Note that the call to <a href="api/jess/Rete.html#batch(java.lang.String)"><tt><tt>jess.Rete.</tt>batch(java.lang.String)</tt></a>
                will find the file <tt>myrules.clp</tt> not
                only in the current directory but even if it's packaged in a jar file
                with the <tt>PricingEngine</tt> class, or put into the <tt>WEB-INF/classes</tt> directory of a Web application.
                Jess tries to find the file using a succession of different class loaders before giving up.
            </p>

            
<p>Then whenever you want to process an order, the pricing
                engine needs to do four things: reset the engine back
                to its initial state; load the order data; execute the
                rules; and extract the results. In this case the
                results will be <tt>Offer</tt> objects in working
                memory, put there by the rules; each <tt>Offer</tt>
                represents some kind of special pricing deal to be
                applied to the order. We'll write a short private
                routine for one of these steps, and then a single
                public method that performs all four steps on behalf
                of clients of the pricing engine.</p>

            
<p>First, a short routine to load the order data into Jess:</p>


<div class="example">
<pre>
    private void loadOrderData(int orderNumber) throws JessException {
        // Retrive the order from the database
        Order order = database.getOrder(orderNumber);

        if (order != null) {
           // Add the order and its contents to working memory
           engine.add(order);
           engine.add(order.getCustomer());
           engine.addAll(order.getItems());
        }
    }
</pre>
</div>

            
<p>Now the pricing engine's business method, which takes an order
                number and returns an Iterator over the applicable offers. We use one
            of Jess's predefined <a href="api/jess/Filter.html"><tt>jess.Filter</tt></a> implementations to select only
            the <tt>Offer</tt> objects from working memory.</p>


<div class="example">
<pre>
    public Iterator run(int orderNumber) throws JessException {
        // Remove any previous order data, leaving only catalog data
        engine.resetToMark(marker);

        // Load data for this order
        loadOrderData(orderNumber);

        // Fire the rules that apply to this order
        engine.run();

        // Return the list of offers created by the rules
        return engine.getObjects(new Filter.ByClass(Offer.class));
    }
</pre>
</div>

            
<p>That's it! Now any servlet, EJB, or other Java code can instantiate
                a <tt>PricingEngine</tt> and use it to find the offers that apply to a given
                order... once we write the rules, that is.</p>

            
<p>A note about error handling: I've exposed JessException in the
                interface to all of these methods. I could have hidden JessException
                inside them by catching JessException and rethrowing a non-Jess
                exception. I've chosen not to do that here just to make the code
                shorter.</p>

        

        
<a name="rules">
<h3>11.4. Making your own rules</h3>
</a>

            
<p>All that's left is to write the rules. Our rules will be matching
            against some simple Java model objects. Imagine you've already got some
            model objects being used elsewhere in your system:
            <a href="quickstart_code.html#Customer">Customer</a>
            , <a href="quickstart_code.html#Offer">Offer</a>
            , <a href="quickstart_code.html#Order">Order</a>
            ,
            <a href="quickstart_code.html#OrderItem">OrderItem</a>
            , and
            <a href="quickstart_code.html#CatalogItem">CatalogItem</a>
            .  </p>

            
<p>Now all we have to do is express the business rules as Jess
                rules. Every rule has a name, an optional documentation string, some
                <i>patterns</i>
                , and some
                <i>actions.</i>
                A
                <i>pattern</i>
                is
                statement of something that must be true for the rule to apply. An
                <i>action</i>
                is something the rule should do if it does apply. Let's
                see how some of our pricing rules would look in Jess.
            </p>

            
<blockquote>
                "Give a 10% discount to everybody who spends more than $100."
            </blockquote>


<div class="jesscode">


<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(defrule 10%-volume-discount
    "Give a 10% discount to everybody who spends more than $100."
    ?o &lt;-(Order {total &gt; 100})
    =&gt;
    (add (new Offer "10% volume discount" (/ ?o.total 10))))</pre>

</div>
            
<p>In a Jess rule, the patterns come before the "=&gt;"
            symbol. This rule applies to <tt>Order</tt> with a
            <tt>total</tt> property greater than $100. Inside the
            curly braces, we can write expressions which look just
            like Boolean expressions in Java. All the properties of an
            object are available to these expressions just by using
            their property names. You can learn more about writing
            rule patterns <a href="rules.html">here</a>.</p>

            
<p>The actions come after the "=&gt;" symbol. If this rule
            applies to an <tt>Order</tt>, a new Java <tt>Offer</tt> object is
            created with a value 10% of the order total, and that
            <tt>Offer</tt> is added to working memory using the <a href="functions.html#add"><tt>add</tt></a> Our
            <tt>PricingEngine</tt> class will find these
            <tt>Offer</tt> objects later.</p>


            
<blockquote>
                "Give a 25% discount on items the customer buys three or more of."
            </blockquote>


<div class="jesscode">


<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(defrule 25%-multi-item-discount
    "Give a 25% discount on items the customer buys three or more of."
    (OrderItem {quantity &gt;= 3} (price ?price))
    =&gt;
    (add (new Offer "25% multi-item discount" (/ ?price 4))))</pre>

</div>

            
<p>In this rule, we use the value of the "price" property
            to compute the discount. Because we don't otherwise
            mention the "price" property, we include the simple
            expression "(price ?price)", which assigns the value of
            the property to the variable "?price."</p>

            
<blockquote>
                "If somebody buys a CD writer, send them a free sample of CD-RW
                disks; but only if they're a repeat customer."
            </blockquote>

            
<div class="jesscode">




<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(defrule free-cd-rw-disks
    "If somebody buys a CD writer, send them a free sample of CD-RW
     disks, catalog number 782321; but only if they're a repeat customer.
    We use a regular expression to match the CD writer's description."
    (CatalogItem (partNumber ?partNumber) (description /CD Writer/))
    (CatalogItem (partNumber 782321) (price ?price))
    (OrderItem (partNumber ?partNumber))
    (Customer {orderCount &gt; 1})
    =&gt;	
    (add (new Offer "Free CD-RW disks" ?price)))</pre>
</div>

            
<p>This rule is more complicated because it includes
            <i>correlations</i> between objects. Because we used the
            same variable <tt>?partNumber</tt> in two different
            patterns, the rule will only match when the corresponding
            properties of two objects are equal -- i.e., when the
            <tt>partNumber</tt> of an <tt>OrderItem</tt> is the same
            as the <tt>partNumber</tt> of a <tt>CatalogItem</tt> that
            represents a CD writer. </p>

            
<p>Also noteworthy: we've tested the "description"
            property of the <tt>CatalogItem</tt> object with a simple
            Java <i>regular expression.</i> If the phrase "CD Writer"
            appears anywhere in the description, that CatalogItem will
            match the pattern.</p>

<h3>11.5. Multiple Rule Engines</h3>
</a>
        
<p>Each
        <tt>jess.Rete</tt>
        object represents an
        independent reasoning engine. A single program can include
        any number of engines. The individual <tt>Rete</tt> objects can each have their own working memories,
            agendas, and rulebases, and can all function in separate threads. You can use multiple identical engines in a pool, or
            each engine can have its own rules, perhaps because you intend for them to interact in some way.
        </p>                   
            
<a name="peering">
<h4>11.5.1. Peering: Sharing Rules Among Multiple Engines</h4>
</a>
            
<p>Of course, creating multiple independent engines and then loading the same set of
                rules into each seems inefficient: the same rules would be parsed and compiled once for each engine,
            and you'd have a lot of redundant data structures. Therefore Jess supports <i>peering</i> of rule engines. With peering,
                you load and compile a rule base just once to create the first engine, and then you can create multiple
                independent <i>peer</i> engines which share the compiled rules. The peers all share their tables of rules,
                functions, templates, and defglobals, as well as their classloader, but each peer has its own
                agenda, working memory and execution context. That means they all apply the same set of rules, but to data
                unique to each peer. No peer sees facts asserted into the working memory of any other peer.
                </p>
                
<p>On the other hand, changes to the rule base, template list, function list, etc, are seen by all the
                    members of a peered set, regardless of which engine the changes are made through.</p>
                
                
<p>All peers, including the first engine, are equivalent. Once a peer is created, the first
                    engine and the peer behave identically; the first engine is not special in any way. Either of them can be used
                    to create new peers.
                </p>
                
<p>Creating a peer is a fast operation, and of course peering uses less memory than creating
                    independent engines. These properties make peers ideal for use in pools in Web applications. You can
                    create a pool of peers, remove one from the pool to service a client request, and then return it to the pool.</p>

                
<p>The following simple example shows how to use peering. The API consists solely of a special constructor
                    in the Rete class:</p>


<div class="javacode">
<pre>
    
import jess.*;
public class ExPeering {
    public static void main(String[] argv) throws JessException {
        // Create the "original" engine

        // Load a rule into it
        engine.eval("(defrule rule-1 (A ?x) =&gt; (printout t ?x crlf))");

        // Create a peer of the first engine
        Rete peer = engine.createPeer();

        // Assert different facts into the two engines
        engine.assertString("(A original)");
        peer.assertString("(A peer)");

        // Run the original engine; prints "original"
        engine.run();

        // Run the peer; prints "peer"
        peer.run();
    }

<h3>11.6. Jess in a Multithreaded Environment</h3>
</a>
            
<p>
            Jess can be used in a multithreaded environment. The
            <tt>jess.Rete</tt>
            class internally synchronizes itself using several
            synchronization locks. The most important lock is a lock on working memory:
            only one thread will be allowed to change the working memory of a given
            <tt>jess.Rete</tt> object at a time.
            </p>
            
<p>
                The <tt>Rete.run()</tt> method, like the <tt>(run)</tt> function in the Jess programming language,
                returns as soon as there are no more applicable rules. In a multithreaded environment, it is
                generally appropriate for the engine to simply wait instead, because rules may be activated due to
                working memory changes that happen on another thread. That's the purpose of the <tt>Rete.runUntilHalt()</tt>
                method and the <tt>(run-until-halt)</tt> function, which use Java's <tt>wait()/notify()</tt> system to pause the
                calling thread until active rules are available to fire. <tt>runUntilHalt</tt> and <tt>(run-until-halt)</tt> won't
                return until <tt>Rete.halt()</tt> or <tt>(halt)</tt> are called, as the names suggest.

<p> Our <tt>PricingEngine</tt> class is stateful and not
            meant to be used in a multithreaded way. This is by
            design. If you want to use a <tt>PricingEngine</tt> in a
            Web application, then your choices are analagous to your
            choices in using JDBC <tt>Connection</tt> objects: either
            create new ones as needed, which is simple, but
            inefficient; or use an object pool and a finite collection
            of objects which are checked out, used, and returned to
            the pool. The important point is that multiple
            <tt>PricingEngine</tt> objects will be absolutely
            independent, and you can create as few or as many as you
            need for a given application.

<h3>11.7. Error Reporting and Debugging</h3>
</a>

            
<p>I'm constantly trying to improve Jess's error reporting,
                but it is still not perfect. When you get an error from
                Jess (during parsing or at runtime) it is generally delivered as a Java
                exception. The exception will contain an explanation of the problem. If you print a
                stack trace of the exception, it can also help you understand what went wrong.
                For this reason, it is <i>very important</i> that, if you're embedding
                Jess in a Java application, you <i>don't</i> write code like this:</p>

            
<div class="example">
<pre>
// Don't ignore exceptions like this!
try {
Rete engine = new Rete();
engine.eval("(gibberish!)");
} catch (JessException ex) { /* ignore errors */ }
            </pre>
</div>

            If you ignore the Java exceptions, you will miss Jess's explanations
            of what's wrong with your code. Don't laugh - more people code this
            way than you'd think!
            <p></p>
            Anyway, as an example, if you attempt to load the folowing rule in the
            standard Jess command-line executable,

            <div class="example">
<pre>
; There is an error in this rule
Jess&gt; (defrule foo-1
(foo bar)
-&gt;
(printout "Found Foo Bar" crlf))
            </pre>
</div>

            You'll get the following printout:

            <div class="example">
<pre>
Jess reported an error in routine Jesp.parseDefrule.
Message: Expected '=&gt;' at token '-&gt;'.
Program text: ( defrule foo-1 ( foo bar ) -&gt;  at line 3.
            </pre>
</div>

            This exception, like all exceptions reported by Jess, lists a Java
            routine name. The name <tt>parseDefrule</tt> makes it fairly clear
            that a rule was being parsed, and the detail message explains
            that <tt>-&gt;</tt> was found in the input instead of the expected
            <tt>=&gt;</tt> symbol (we accidentally typed <tt>-&gt;</tt> instead). This
            particular error message, then, was fairly easy to understand.

            <p></p>Runtime errors can be more puzzling, but the printout will
            generally give you a lot of information. Here's a rule where we
            erroneously try to add the number <tt>3.0</tt> to the word <tt>four</tt>:
            <div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(defrule foo-2
=&gt;
(printout t (+ 3.0 four) crlf))
            </pre>
</div>

            This rule will compile fine, since the parser doesn't know that the
            <tt>+</tt> function won't accept the symbol <tt>four</tt> as an argument.
            When we <tt>(reset)</tt> and <tt>(run)</tt>, however,  we'll see:

            <div class="example">
<pre>
Jess reported an error in routine +
  while executing (+ 3.0 four)
  while executing (printout t (+ 3.0 four) crlf)
  while executing defrule MAIN::foo-2
  while executing (run).
Message: Not a number: four.
  Program text: ( run )  at line 12.
            </pre>
</div>

            In this case, the error message is also pretty clear. It shows the
            offending function (+ 3.0 four); then the function that called that
            (printout); the message then shows the context in which the function was called
            (defrule MAIN::foo-2), and finally the function which caused the rule to
            fire (run).  <p></p>

            
<p></p>The message 'Not a number: four' tells you that
            the <tt>+</tt> function wanted a numeric argument, but found the
            symbol <tt>four</tt> instead.

            <p></p>
            If we make a similar mistake on the LHS of a rule:
            <div class="example">
<pre>
Jess&gt; (defrule foo-3
(test (eq 3 (+ 2 one)))                                         -
=&gt;
)
            </pre>
</div>
            We see the following after a <tt>reset</tt>:
            <div class="example">
<pre>
Jess reported an error in routine +
  while executing (+ 2 one)
  while executing (eq 3 (+ 2 one))
  while executing 'test' CE
  while executing rule LHS (TECT)
  while executing (reset).
Message: Not a number: one.
  Program text: ( reset )  at line 22.
            </pre>
</div>

            Again, the error message is very detailed, and makes it clear, I hope,
            that the error occurred during rule LHS execution, in a <tt>test</tt>
            CE, in the function <tt>(+ 2 one).</tt> Note that Jess cannot tell you
            which rule this LHS belongs to, since rule LHSs can be shared.

<h3>11.8. Creating Rules from Java</h3>
</a>

            
<p>It is now possible to create Jess rules and queries using only the
                Java API -- i.e., without writing either a Jess language or XML
                version of the rule. This isn't recommended -- part of the power of a
                rule engine is the ability it gives you to separate your rules from
                your other code -- but sometimes it may be worth doing. </p>

            
<p>Defining rules from Java is complex, and is still an undocumented process.
            If you're interested in doing it, your best resource is the source code for the <tt>jess.xml</tt>
                package, which uses Jess's public APIs to build rules. Be aware that these APIs may change
                without notice.
            </p>
