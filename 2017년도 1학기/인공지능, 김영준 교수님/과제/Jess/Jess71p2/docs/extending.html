<h2>12.
        Adding Commands to Jess</h2>

The Java interface <tt>jess.Userfunction</tt> represents a single
function in the Jess language. You can add new functions to the Jess
language simply by writing a class that implements the
<tt>jess.Userfunction</tt> interface (see below for details on how
this is done), creating a single instance of this class and installing
it into a <tt>jess.Rete</tt> object using
<tt>Rete.addUserfunction()</tt>. The <tt>Userfunction</tt> classes you
write can maintain state; therefore a <tt>Userfunction</tt> can cache
results across invocations, maintain complex data structures, or keep
references to external Java objects for callbacks. A single
<tt>Userfunction</tt> can be a gateway into a complex Java subsystem.


<a name="extensions">
<h3>12.1. Writing Extensions</h3>
</a>
I've made it as easy as possible to add user-defined functions to Jess.
There is no system type-checking on arguments, so you don't need to tell
the system about your arguments, and values are self-describing, so you
don't need to tell the system what type you return. You do, however, need
to understand several Jess classes, including <tt>jess.Value</tt>,
<tt>jess.Context</tt>, and <tt>jess.Funcall</tt>, as previously
discussed in the chapter
<a href="library.html">Introduction to Programming with Jess in Java</a>.


<a name="implementing_userfunction">
<h4>12.1.1. Implementing             your Userfunction</h4>
</a>


<p></p>
To implement the <tt>jess.Userfunction</tt> interface, you need to implement
only two methods: <tt>getName()</tt> and <tt>call().</tt> Here's an example
of a class called 'MyUpcase' that implements the Jess function <tt>my-upcase</tt>,
which expects a String as an argument, and returns the string in uppercase.
<div class="javacode">
<pre>
    
import jess.*;

public class ExMyUpcase implements Userfunction {
    // The name method returns the name by which
    // the function will appear in Jess code.
    public String getName() { return "my-upcase"; }

    public Value call(ValueVector vv, Context context) throws JessException {
        String result = vv.get(1).stringValue(context).toUpperCase();
        return new Value(result, RU.STRING);
      }
  }

</pre>
</div>

The <tt>call()</tt> method does the business of your
Userfunction. When <tt>call()</tt> is invoked, the first argument will
be a <tt>ValueVector</tt> representation of the Jess code that evoked
your function. For example, if the following Jess function calls were
made,

<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(load-function ExMyUpcase)</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(my-upcase foo)</pre>

<pre>
<i>"FOO"</i>
</pre>

</div>

the first argument to <tt>call()</tt> would be a <tt>ValueVector</tt>
of length two. The first element would be a <tt>Value</tt> containing
the symbol (type <tt>RU.SYMBOL</tt>) <tt>my-upcase</tt>, and the second
argument would be a <tt>Value</tt> containing the string
(<tt>RU.STRING</tt>) <tt>"foo"</tt>.

<p></p> Note that we use <tt>vv.get(1).stringValue(context)</tt> to get
the first argument to <tt>my-upcase</tt> as a Java String. If the
argument doesn't contain a string, or something convertible to a
string, <tt>stringValue()</tt> will throw a <tt>JessException</tt>
describing the problem; hence you don't need to worry about incorrect
argument types if you don't want to. <tt>vv.get(0)</tt> will always
return the symbol <tt>my-upcase</tt>, the name of the function being
called (the clever programmer will note that this would let you
construct multiple objects of the same class, implementing different
functions based on the name of the function passed in as a constructor
argument). If you want, you can check how many arguments your function
was called with and throw a JessException if it was the wrong number
by using the <tt>vv.size()</tt> method. In any case, our simple
implementation extracts a single argument and uses the Java
<tt>toUpperCase()</tt> method to do its work. <tt>call()</tt> must
wrap its return value in a <tt>jess.Value</tt> object, specifying the
type (here it is <tt>RU.STRING</tt>).

<a name="userfunction_return_values">
<h5>12.1.1.1. Legal return                values</h5>
</a>

A <tt>Userfunction</tt> must return a valid <tt>jess.Value</tt>
          object; it cannot return the Java <tt>null</tt> value. To
          return "no value" to Jess, use <tt>nil</tt>. The value of
          <tt>nil</tt> is available in the public static final
          variable <tt>jess.Funcall.NIL.</tt>



<a name="loading_userfunctions">
<h4>12.1.2. Loading             your Userfunction</h4>
</a>


<p></p> Having written this class, you can then, in your Java main
program, simply call <tt>Rete.addUserfunction()</tt> with an instance
of your new class as an argument, and the function will be available
from Jess code. So, we could have

<div class="javacode">
<pre>

import jess.*;
public class ExAddUF {
  public static void main(String[] argv) throws JessException {
    // Add the 'my-upcase' command to Jess
    Rete r = new Rete();
    r.addUserfunction(new ExMyUpcase());

    // This will print "FOO".
    System.out.println(r.eval("(my-upcase foo)"));
  }
}
<b>C:\&gt;</b> java ExAddUF
<pre>
<i>"FOO"</i>
</pre>

</pre>
</div>

Alternatively, the Jess language command <a href="functions.html#load-function"><tt>load-function</tt></a> could
be used to load <tt>my-upcase</tt> from Jess:

<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(load-function ExMyUpcase)</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(my-upcase foo)</pre>

<pre>
<i>"FOO"</i>
</pre>

</div>



<a name="assert_from_userfunctions">
<h4>12.1.3. Calling assert             from a Userfunction</h4>
</a>


The <tt>jess.Rete.assertFact()</tt> method has two overloads: one version
            takes a <tt>jess.Context</tt> argument, and the other does
            not. When writing a Userfunction, you should always use
            the first version, passing the <tt>jess.Context</tt>
            argument to the Userfunction. If you do not, your
            Userfunction will not interact correctly with the <a href="rules.html#logical_ce"> <tt>logical</tt>
            conditional element.</a>






<a name="packages">
<h3>12.2. Writing Extension Packages</h3>
</a>

The <tt>jess.Userpackage</tt> interface is a handy way to group a collection
of <tt>Userfunctions</tt> together, so that you don't need to install them
one by one (all of the extensions shipped with Jess are included in Userpackage
classes). A <tt>Userpackage</tt> class should supply the one method <tt>add(),</tt>
which should simply add a collection of <tt>Userfunctions</tt> to a
<tt>Rete</tt> object using
<tt>addUserfunction().</tt> Nothing mysterious going on, but it's very
convenient. As an example, suppose <tt>MyUpcase</tt> was only one of a
number of similar functions you wrote. You could put them in a
<tt>Userpackage</tt> class like this:

<div class="javacode">
<pre>

import jess.*;
public class ExMyStringFunctions implements Userpackage {
    public void add(Rete engine) {
        engine.addUserfunction(new ExMyUpcase());
        // Other similar statements
    }
}

</pre>
</div>

Now in your Java code, you can call
<div class="javacode">
<pre>

import jess.*;
public class ExAddUP {
  public static void main(String[] argv) throws JessException {
    // Add the 'my-upcase' command to Jess
    Rete r = new Rete();
    r.addUserpackage(new ExMyStringFunctions());

    // This will still print FOO.
    System.out.println(r.eval("(my-upcase foo)"));
  }
}
<b>C:\&gt;</b> java ExAddUP
<pre>
<i>"FOO"</i>
</pre>

</pre>
</div>

or from your Jess code, you can call

<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(load-package ExMyStringFunctions)</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(my-upcase foo)</pre>

<pre>
<i>"FOO"</i>
</pre>

</div>

to load these functions in. After either of these snippets, Jess
language code could call <tt>my-upcase</tt>, <tt>my-downcase</tt>, etc.

<p></p>

<tt>Userpackage</tt>s are a great place to assemble a collection of
interrelated functions which potentially can share data or maintain references
to other function objects. You can also use <tt>Userpackage</tt>s to make
sure that your <tt>Userfunction</tt>s are constructed with the correct
constructor arguments.

<p></p>
All of Jess's "built-in" functions are simply <tt>Userfunctions</tt>,
albeit ones which have special access to Jess' innards. Most of them
are automatically loaded by code in the <tt>jess.Funcall</tt>
class. You can use these as examples for writing your own Jess extensions.





<a name="getting_references">
<h3>12.3. Obtaining References to Userfunction Objects</h3>
</a>

Occasionally it is useful to be able to obtain a reference to an installed
<tt>Userfunction</tt> object. The method <tt>Userfunction Rete.findUserfunction(String
name)</tt> lets you do this easily. It returns the <tt>Userfunction</tt>
object registered under the given name, or null if there is none. This
is useful when you write Userfunctions which themselves maintain state
of some kind, and you need access to that state.
