<h2>21.
        Release Notes</h2>

        
<p>Jess 7.1 introduces some new features on top of the
            foundation laid in Jess 7.0.</p> 

        
<a name="new_features71">
<h3>21.1. New features in Jess 7.1</h3>
</a>

	  
<p>
<b>Templates inherit declarables from parent.</b> In
	  particular, templates inherit backwards chaining reactivity
	  and slot-specific behavior from their parent template (if
	  they have one.)</p>

        
<p>
<b>Test CEs allowed in logical.</b> You're now allowed to
        use <tt>test</tt> inside of the <tt>logical</tt> CE.</p>

        
<p>
<b>Alternative character sets.</b> The <a href="functions.html#batch"><tt>batch</tt></a> function and the <a href="api/jess/Batch.html"><tt>jess.Batch</tt></a>
        class's various methods can accept a charset argument, so Jess
        can read files written in arbitrary character sets.</p>

           
<p>
<b>Test CE folding.</b> The <tt>test</tt> conditional element is now
               more efficient -- in fact, its performance is equivalent to declaring
               the same tests somewhere in the preceding pattern. A <tt>test</tt>
               pattern is no longer compiled to a real join node in the Rete network.
               You can now use the <tt>test</tt> CE anywhere you want to improve program
               readability or in generated code, without penalty.
           </p>
           
           
<p>
<b>Automatic strength reduction.</b> Many uses of the "eq" and "neq"
               functions in the patterns of a rule will be automatically converted to more
               efficient direct matching. Although direct matching is still to be preferred
               because it is less verbose, generated code can use "eq" and "neq" uniformly
               with other functions and Jess will do this optimization when possible.</p>

            
<p>
<b>Dot notation.</b> The
            "simplified" or "Java" patterns can now use a "dot
            notation" to reference slots in other patterns. This
            powerful capability greatly expands the usefulness of Java
            patterns and makes auto-generating Jess code much easier. Futhermore, The
            notation "?x.y" in procedural code will be interpreted as "slot y of the fact in x".</p>

            
<p>
<b>Name restrictions.</b>Slot names and variable names may not contain
            a period ('.').</p>

            
<p>
<b>Variables not bound by Java patterns.</b> The
            semantics of Java patterns, introduced in Jess 7.0, have
            changed slightly. These patterns no longer bind
            user-accessible variables to any slots they're used in. To
            access slot values of facts matched by Java patterns, use
            the <a href="functions.html#fact-slot-value"><tt>fact-slot-value</tt></a> function or the <a href="api/jess/Fact.html#getSlotValue(java.lang.String)"><tt><tt>jess.Fact.</tt>getSlotValue(java.lang.String)</tt></a> method.</p>

            
<p>
<b>allowed-values.</b> Template slots can now use the
            allowed-values qualifier, which states which discrete
            values a slot can hold. Jess will verify that your code
            obeys this statically; optionally, it can also be verified
            at runtime. Using allowed-values where appropriate will
            take advantage of some new optimizations to be implemented
            in Jess 7.1.</p>

            
<p>
<b>Peering of Rete objects.</b> <a href="api/jess/Rete.html"><tt>jess.Rete</tt></a>
                objects can share their rule networks, resulting
                in reduced memory footprint and faster setup times
                when you're using multiple engines in a single
                application.</p>

            
<p>
                
<b>elif.</b> The <a href="functions.html#if"><tt>if</tt></a> function supports
                <tt>elif</tt> blocks.
            </p>

            
<p> 
<b>ValueFactory.</b> Jess uses a pooling factory for
                Value objects, resulting in generally lower memory
                consumption if you parse a lot of data. You can use
                the same factory for the Value object you create.               
                If you modify your code to use it, you can
                conserve memory since ValueFactory caches some of the
                Values it creates. HashCodeComputer, the class that
                Jess uses to keep track of which objects a "value
                objects", is also public.
                </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>break.</b> The <a href="functions.html#break"><tt>break</tt></a> function lets
                you terminate loops early as well as return from the
                actions of a rule without popping the focus stack.
            </p>

            
<p>
<b>Removing constructs.</b> The <a href="api/jess/Rete.html"><tt>jess.Rete</tt></a> class now includes methods for
            removing modules, templates, globals, and all other constructs.</p>

        

        
<a name="new_features">
<h3>21.2. New features in Jess 7.0</h3>
</a>
      
<p>Jess 7 has many new features. The manual has had a major
      rewrite for this version, although some new features may be
      underdocumented. These notes are intended to help with that.</p>

      
<p>New features in Jess 7 include, in no particular order:</p>

            
<p>
                
<b>Java patterns.</b>
            You can use a new, simplified syntax for pattern
            matching that looks a lot like Java Boolean expressions. You can read
                about it <a href="rules.html#patterns_simple">here.</a>
</p>


            
<p>
                
<b>Static imports.</b>
            Importing a class now causes all its static members to
            be defined as functions. See <a href="functions.html#import">here</a> for details about
            this new and useful feature!</p>

            
<p>
                
<b>Lambda expressions.</b>
            You can now create unnamed functions and easily use
            them to implement Java interfaces. See <a href="jessgui.html#events">here</a> for details.</p>


            
<p>
                
<b>New default for <a href="functions.html#definstance"><tt>definstance</tt></a>.</b> The
                definstance function's default behavior is now to use
                PropertyChangeEvents whenever they are available. It's
                generally not necessary to use the "static" or
                "dynamic" qualifiers anymore, unless you want to force
                Jess not to use a PropertyChangeListener even when
                that facility is available. You can explicitly use a
                qualifier of "auto" as a synonym for the default.
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>Eclipse-based IDE.</b> Charlemagne includes a rule
            development environment called "JessDE" based on the
            Eclipse open-source IDE. The toolset includes an editor, a
            debugger, and a host of small tools to help with rule
            development and deployment. You can read more about it
            <a href="eclipse.html">here.</a>
</p>

            
<p>
                
<b>Simplified defquery syntax.</b> A new
        <tt>run-query*</tt> function brings a JDBC-like interface to
        working memory queries. Read about it <a href="queries.html">here.</a>
            
</p>

            
<p>
                
<b>The "slot-specific" declaration for templates.</b>
      Deftemplate definitions can now include a "declare" section just
      as defrules can. There are several different properties that can
      be declared. One is "slot-specific". Changes to facts from slot-specific
                templates won't trigger rule activations unless the modified
            slot is actually mentioned on the LHS of the rule.</p>

            
<p>
                
<b>The "backchain-reactive" declaration for
      templates.</b> This declaration lets you declare that a
      template is backward chaining reactive when you create it,
      rather than after the fact.
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>The "from-class" declaration for templates.</b>
      This provides a different syntax for defining templates based
      on Java classes. Using "from-class", you can apply all the
      other template declarations to shadow fact templates.
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>Public member variables as slots.</b> When you
      define a template using the deftemplate from-class syntax or
      using the Rete.defclass() method, you can tell Jess to include
      public member variables as slots in the template. Do this by
      passing "true" as the optional fourth argument to
      Rete.defclass(), or by including the declaration
      "(include-variables TRUE)" in your deftemplate. There is not yet
      a way to turn this feature on when using the defclass function.
            </p>


            
<p>
                
<b>The "no-loop" declaration for rules.</b> If you use
                <tt>(declare (no-loop TRUE))</tt>, then nothing that a rule does
      while firing can cause the immediate reactivation of the same
      rule; i.e., if a no-loop rule matches a fact, and the rule modifies that
      same fact such that the fact still matches, the rule will not be
      put back on the agenda, avoiding an infinite loop.
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>Matching with regular expressions, and the
                    <tt>regexp</tt> function.  </b> Under JDK 1.4 and
                    up, Jess 7 has regular expressions support. You
                    can directly match any field with a regular
                    expression.
            </p>


            
<p>
                
<b>The -stacktrace switch.</b> The error messages
      printed by the <tt>jess.Main</tt> class have always
      (deliberately) included a stack trace to help you find the
      specific part of Jess that rejected your input. Unfortunately,
      stack traces are frightening to many
      non-programmers. Furthermore, some people assume that when they
      see a stack trace, they're seeing a bug in Jess. Therefore,
      <tt>jess.Main</tt>'s new default behavior is not to display a
      stack trace on error. To get the old behavior, you can include
      the <tt>-stacktrace</tt> command-line switch when you start
      <tt>jess.Main</tt>.
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>RU.LONG is now a first-class type.</b> You can write long
      literals by appending an "L" to an integral value. Values of
      "long" type can now be used in arithmetic and logical
      expressions. The
                <tt>long</tt> function still exists but, as
      it's no longer needed, it is deprecated.
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>The "forall" conditional element.</b> Jess now
      includes a "forall" conditional element. The "forall" grouping
      CE matches if, for every match of the first pattern inside it,
      all the subsequent patterns match. See <a href="rules.html#forall_ce">here</a> for more information.
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>The "accumulate" conditional element.</b> The "accumulate"
      CE is lets you count facts, add up fields, store data into
      collections, etc, all as a part of pattern matching. See <a href="rules.html#accumulate_ce">here</a> for more information. </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>Subrules no longer user-visible.</b> The "or" CE causes
      rules that use it to be broken into subrules, as described in
      the manual. However, the individual subrules will no longer be
      visible to the user; they're an implementation detail that
      should not concern most programmers.
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>Native XML parser.</b> Jess 7 defines its own XML
      rule format, <i>JessML</i>, designed so that it's easy for the
      language to support Jess's special features. An XML Schema file
      describing this format is included in the distribution. We hope
      to eventually provide XSLT scripts to transform this language
      into RuleML and other standard rule languages.  Several examples
      of the XML format are included in the examples directory which
      are exact machine translations of standard Jess examples. The
      <tt>batch</tt> function knows how to read these XML files in,
      and there are a number of useful public Java classes in the
      package <tt>jess.xml</tt> for working with this new format,
      including a tool to translate any Jess code into JessML.
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>Public API for rule creation.</b> The XML parser is
      defined in its own package, and works by creating jess.Defrule
      objects using the Java API. This is an existence proof that such
      a thing is now possible. Documentation on <i>how</i> is
      forthcoming.
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>Better handling for objects with mutable
      hashCodes.</b> Object identity in Java is a slippery thing, as
      experienced programmers know; the interpretation of identity and
      equality can be intimately tied to the class-specific
      implementations of the <tt>equals</tt> and <tt>hashCode</tt>
      methods. Jess has historically had some problems with Java
      objects whose hash code changes over time. These problems have
      been resolved in Jess 7. Objects with changing hashCodes can be
      safely added to working memory even in situations that have
      caused problems in the past.  See <a href="java.html#equals_and_hashcode">"Java objects in working
      memory"</a> for details.
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>Better reflection performance.</b> Jess's performance
      while scripting Java objects in procedural code has improved by
      20-50% in this release, especially in loops.
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>Better method names.</b> The
                <tt>RU.EXTERNAL_ADDRESS</tt> constant, the
                <tt>jess.Value.externalAddressValue()</tt> method, and
                the <a href="functions.html#external-addressp"><tt>external-addressp</tt></a> function are all
                deprecated in favor of the new equivalents
                <tt>RU.JAVA_OBJECT</tt>,
                <tt>jess.Value.javaObjectValue()</tt>, and <a href="functions.html#java-objectp"><tt>java-objectp</tt></a>.
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>New overloaded add() methods.</b> The <a href="api/jess/ValueVector.html"><tt>jess.ValueVector</tt></a> class has a
                new set of overloaded <tt>add()</tt> methods that make Java code that uses Jess lists
                look cleaner.
            </p>

	    
<p>
	      
<b>CLEAR.</b> One minor but potentially important
	      behavioral change in this release is that the
	      <a href="api/jess/Rete.html#clear()"><tt><tt>jess.Rete.</tt>clear()</tt></a> method
	      doesn't modify the event mask, set of event listeners,
	      or watch state. Although this is a break with the
	      traditional semantics of the clear() method, it makes
	      more sense, especially for embedded applications.
	    </p>



        

        
<a name="porting7">
<h3>21.3. Porting from Jess 7</h3>
</a>
          
<p>Jess 7 code will generally run fine in Jess 7.1, with a
          few small exceptions. One issue is that the period character
          '.' is no longer valid in variable or slot names, since the
          period is now used as a "dot operator" to denote
          membership. If this breaks existing code, you can choose to
          use some other character (we suggest the octothorpe '#') as
          a membership operator by adding the following to the
          beginning of your Jess code:</p>
          
<pre>
            ((engine) setMemberChar #)
          </pre>
        

        
<a name="porting6">
<h3>21.4. Porting from Jess 6</h3>
</a>
      In general, Jess 6 applications will run unchanged (either Java API
      code, or Jess language code,) with a few exceptions, as noted
      below. Nevertheless, you may want to change your application to
      take advantage of some of the newer features -- for example, the
      new <tt>run-query*</tt> method.

            <p>
<b>Restrictions on variable names.</b> Jess 7 accepts a
            more limited syntax for variable names than did earlier
            versions of Jess. Only letters, numbers, dash, asterisk,
            colon, and underscore are legal characters in variable
            names in this release; in particular, the period (.)
            character is no longer allowed as part of a variable
            name. Hopefully this won't affect any existing code.
            </p>


            
<p>
                
<b>Newly deprecated methods.</b> The
                <tt>Rete.executeCommand()</tt> method is deprecated in favor
                of the new <tt>eval()</tt> method.
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>Previously deprecated methods removed.</b> All deprecated methods
      from Jess 6 have been removed from Jess 7. In particular, the
      "assert()" method from the Rete class has been replaced with
      "assertFact()".
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>New deprecated functions.</b>The Jess function
                "multifieldp" is now deprecated; use "listp"
                instead. The <tt>RU.EXTERNAL_ADDRESS</tt> constant,
                the <tt>jess.Value.externalAddressValue()</tt> method,
                and the <a href="functions.html#external-addressp"><tt>external-addressp</tt></a> function are
                all deprecated in favor of the new equivalents
                <tt>RU.JAVA_OBJECT</tt>,
                <tt>jess.Value.javaObjectValue()</tt>, and <a href="functions.html#java-objectp"><tt>java-objectp</tt></a>.
            </p>

            
<p>
                
<b>USERFUNCTION_CALLED events.</b>The data associated with a JessEvent of type
      USERFUNCTION_CALLED is no longer a Userfunction object; it's now
      a Funcall object.

<b>Context.setVariable() behavior changed.</b>The
      setVariable() method of jess.Context behaves a little
      differently now. In general, you won't notice a change unless
      you were using variables defined at the command prompt as if
      they were global variables. They never were, and never acted as
      if they were -- and they're even less so now.

<b>Arguments to "batch".</b>The path argument to the Jess
      function "batch" must be a double-quoted string; using an
      unquoted symbol instead will lead to undefined behavior.

<b>Value objects.</b> Jess now assumes that all objects
            (except for Collections) are value objects by default. If
            you're working with a class that is
                <i>not</i> a value
            class, it's very important that you tell Jess about it by
            using the
                <a href="functions.html#set-value-class"><tt>set-value-class</tt></a>
            function. See
                <a href="java.html#equals_and_hashcode">"Java
            objects in working memory"</a> for details.
            </p>

<b>Return types.</b> A very few public methods that used
                to return concrete collection classes are now declared to return the
                corresponding interface; for example, Rete.getSupportingTokens()
                now returns List rather than ArrayList.
