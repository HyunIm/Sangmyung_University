<h2>7.
        Querying Working Memory</h2>


<p>Jess's working memory is similar to a database; it's filled with indexed, structured data.
 Most of the time, you'll access working memory by pattern matching from a rule. But once in a while,
 you'll write some procedural code that needs to extract data from working memory directly. This chapter
 tells you how.</p>


<a name="filters">
<h3>7.1. Linear search</h3>
</a>
        
<p>A time-honored way to search a collection of items is by using linear search and a <i>filter</i>,
            a Boolean function that
            indicates whether an item should be part of the search result or not. Jess supports this kind of brute-force
            search of Java objects in working memory using the <a href="api/jess/Filter.html"><tt>jess.Filter</tt></a> interface. You can implement <a href="api/jess/Filter.html"><tt>jess.Filter</tt></a>
            and then pass an instance of your filter to the <a href="api/jess/Rete.html#getObjects(jess.Filter)"><tt><tt>jess.Rete.</tt>getObjects(jess.Filter)</tt></a> method,
            which will return an <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html"><tt>java.util.Iterator</tt></a> over the selected objects. Although this might not be practical for
            large working memory sizes, it's certainly convenient. In the following, we run a Jess program that deals in <tt>Payment</tt> objects, then
            query working memory for all the <tt>Payment</tt> objects and call <tt>process()</tt> on each one:

<div class="javacode">
<pre>
    
import jess.*;
import java.util.Iterator;
public class ExMyFilter {
    interface Payment { void process(); }
    public static void main(String[] argv) throws JessException {
        Rete engine = new Rete();
        engine.batch("cashier.clp");
        Iterator it = engine.getObjects(new Filter() {
            public boolean accept(Object o) {
                return o instanceof Payment;
            }
        });
        while (it.hasNext()) {
            ((Payment) it.next()).process();
        }
    }
}

</pre>
</div>


</p>



        
<a name="queries">
<h3>7.2. The defquery construct</h3>
</a>
        
<p>

            While linear search is convenient, it's inefficient. The <a href="constructs.html#defquery"><tt>defquery</tt></a> construct lets you create a special kind of rule
with no right-hand-side. While normal rules act spontaneously,
queries are used to search the working memory under direct program
control. Whereas a rule is activated once for each matching set of facts,
a query gives you a <a href="api/jess/QueryResult.html"><tt>jess.QueryResult</tt></a> object which gives you access
to a list of all the matches.</p>

        
<p>Using a defquery involves three steps:
        </p>
        
<ol>
            
<li>
<a href="#write_query">Writing the query</a>
</li>
            
<li>
<a href="#invoke_query">Invoking the query</a>
</li>
            
<li>
<a href="#using_results">Using the results</a>
</li>
        
</ol>


<p>In the following section, we'll examine a specific example of how this is done.</p>



<a name="query_example">
<h3>7.3. A simple example</h3>
</a>

An example should make this clear. We'll go through the three steps listed above, showing one or more ways to perform each step.


<a name="write_query">
<h4>7.3.1. Writing the query</h4>
</a>

Once again, we're writing a program that deals with a database of people.
    Once again, we'll use the following deftemplate

<div class="jesscode">
    
<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(deftemplate person (slot firstName) (slot lastName) (slot age))</pre>

</div>

    
<p>Imagine that we want
    to be able to query working memory to find people with a given last name. Once we've found
    a person, we'll want to know their first name as well, and their age.
    We can write a query which lets us specify the last name we're interested in,
    and also lets us easily recover the first name and age of each match.</p>

    A query looks a lot like the left-hand side of a rule. We write a pattern which matches the facts
    that we're interested in.
    We <i>declare</i> the variable <tt>?ln</tt>, which makes it a parameter to the query,
    and we also include variables <tt>?fn</tt> and <tt>?age</tt> bound to the
    <tt>firstName</tt> and <tt>age</tt> slots, respectively.

<div class="jesscode">


<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(defquery search-by-name
  "Finds people with a given last name"
  (declare (variables ?ln))
  (person (lastName ?ln) (firstName ?fn) (age ?age)))</pre>

</div>


<p>While we're at it, let's define some facts for the query to work
with and load them into working memory:</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(deffacts data
  (person (firstName Fred)   (lastName Smith)    (age 12))
  (person (firstName Fred)   (lastName Jones)    (age 9))
  (person (firstName Bob)    (lastName Thomas)   (age 32))
  (person (firstName Bob)    (lastName Smith)    (age 22))
  (person (firstName Pete)   (lastName Best)     (age 21))
  (person (firstName Pete)   (lastName Smith)    (age 44))
  (person (firstName George) (lastName Smithson) (age 1))
  )</pre>
  
<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(reset)</pre>

</div>





<a name="invoke_query">
<h4>7.3.2. Invoking the query</h4>
</a>

<p>After we define a query, we can call it using the <a href="functions.html#run-query*"><tt>run-query*</tt></a> function in Jess, or the
<a href="api/jess/Rete.html#runQueryStar(java.lang.String, jess.ValueVector)"><tt><tt>jess.Rete.</tt>runQueryStar(java.lang.String, jess.ValueVector)</tt></a>
method in Java. In both cases, we need to pass the last name we're
interested in as the query parameter. In Jess, this looks like
</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(reset)</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(bind ?result (run-query* search-by-name Smith))</pre>

</div>


<p>The arguments to <a href="functions.html#run-query*"><tt>run-query*</tt></a> are the name of the query
      and values for each parameter. The <tt>run-query*</tt> function
      returns a <a href="api/jess/QueryResult.html"><tt>jess.QueryResult</tt></a> object, which we
      store in the variable <tt>?result</tt>.</p>


<p>In Java, the equivalent code would look like:</p>


<div class="example">
<pre>
    Rete engine = ...
    QueryResult result = engine.runQueryStar("search-by-name", new ValueVector().add("Smith"));
</pre>
</div>




<a name="using_results">
<h4>7.3.3. Using the Results</h4>
</a>


<p>Now that we've created a <a href="api/jess/QueryResult.html"><tt>jess.QueryResult</tt></a>, it's
time to iterate over all the matches and process them however we'd
like. For this example, let's just print a table of the people
including their full names and ages.</p>

      
<p>The interface of the <a href="api/jess/QueryResult.html"><tt>jess.QueryResult</tt></a> class is very similar to that of
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSet.html"><tt>java.sql.ResultSet</tt></a>. We use <a href="api/jess/QueryResult.html#next()"><tt><tt>jess.QueryResult.</tt>next()</tt></a> to advance to the next
    result, and we use the set of <tt>getXXX()</tt> methods to return
    the values bound to the variables defined in the query.
      Then the following Jess code will print the output shown:</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(while (?result next)
    (printout t (?result getString fn) " " (?result getString ln)
                ", age " (?result getInt age) crlf))</pre>

<pre>
<i>Fred Smith, age 12
Bob Smith, age 22
Pete Smith, age 44
FALSE</i>
</pre>

</div>


<p>because there are three people named Smith in working memory.</p>


<p>The same loop in Java would look like</p>

<div class="example">
<pre>
while (result.next()) {
    System.out.println(result.getString("fn") + " " + result.getString("ln")
                       + ", age" + result.getInt("age"));
}
</pre>
</div>

    

<a name="in_java">
<h4>7.3.4. One more time, in Java</h4>
</a>
     
<p>For the sake of completeness, here's the whole program in Java. The file "query.clp"
         is assumed to contain the <a href="constructs.html#deftemplate"><tt>deftemplate</tt></a>, <a href="constructs.html#defquery"><tt>defquery</tt></a>, and
     <a href="constructs.html#deffacts"><tt>deffacts</tt></a> from above.</p>

<div class="javacode">
<pre>
    
import jess.*;

public class ExQuery {
    public static void main(String[] argv) throws JessException {
        Rete engine = new Rete();
        engine.batch("query.clp");
        engine.reset();
        QueryResult result =
            engine.runQueryStar("search-by-name", new ValueVector().add("Smith"));
        while (result.next()) {
            System.out.println(result.getString("fn") + " " + result.getString("ln")
                               + ", age" + result.getInt("age"));
        }
    }

<a name="declare_variables">
<h3>7.4. The variable declaration</h3>
</a>

You have already realized that two different kinds of variables
can appear in a query: those that are "internal" to the query, like <tt>?age</tt>
in the query above, and those that are "external", or to be specified in the
        <a href="functions.html#run-query*"><tt>run-query*</tt></a> command when the query is executed,
like <tt>?ln</tt>. Jess assumes
all variables in a query are internal by default; you must declare any
external variables explicitly using the syntax

<div class="example">
<pre>
(declare (variables ?X ?Y ...))
</pre>
</div>

which is quite similar to the syntax of a rule salience declaration.
    

    <a name="max_background_rules">
<h3>7.5. The max-background-rules declaration</h3>
</a>
    It can be convenient to use queries as triggers for backward chaining.
    For this to be useful, <a href="api/jess/Rete.html#run()"><tt><tt>jess.Rete.</tt>run()</tt></a> must be called while the query
    is being evaluated, to allow the backward chaining to occur. Facts generated
    by rules fired during this run may appear as part of the query results. (If this
    makes no sense whatsoever to you, don't worry about it; just skip over
    this section for now.)
        <p></p>
    By default, no rules will fire while a query is being executed. If you want
    to allow backward chaining to occur in response to a query, you can use the
        <tt>max-background-rules</tt> declaration -- i.e.,
        <div class="example">
<pre>
(declare (max-background-rules 10))
        </pre>
</div>
    would allow a maximum of 10 rules to fire while this particular query was being
    executed.
    

    <a name="count-query-results">
<h3>7.6. The count-query-results command</h3>
</a>
To obtain just the number of matches for a query, you can use the
        <a href="functions.html#count-query-results"><tt>count-query-results</tt></a>
function. This function accepts the same arguments as
        <a href="functions.html#run-query*"><tt>run-query*</tt></a>, but just returns an integer, the
number of matches.

    

<a name="use_dotted_in_query">
<h3>7.7. Using dotted variables</h3>
</a>


<p>The <a href="basics.html#dotted_variables">dotted variable</a> syntax
provides a convenient alternative for accessing the slots of a fact
resulting from a query. Let's look at the rewrite the
<tt>search-by-name</tt> query again. This time we'll bind a single variable
to the entire fact, and use dotted variables to retrieve the results.</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(defquery search-by-name
  "Finds people with a given last name"
  (declare (variables ?ln))
  ?person &lt;- (person (lastName ?ln)))</pre>

</div>


<p>Running the query doesn't change:</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(reset)</pre>

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(bind ?result (run-query* search-by-name Smith))</pre>

</div>


<p>This time, we are going to use different code to retrieve the data:</p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(while (?result next)
    (bind ?p (?result getObject person))
    (printout t ?p.firstName " " ?p.lastName ", age " ?p.age crlf))</pre>


<pre>
<i>
Fred Smith, age 12
Bob Smith, age 22
Pete Smith, age 44
FALSE</i>
</pre>

</div>


<p>The <tt>bind</tt> stores the <tt>jess.Fact</tt> object that is
retrieved from the current value of <tt>?result</tt> into variable
<tt>?p</tt>. This, then, is conveniently accessed for its slot
values <tt>firstName</tt>, <tt>lastName</tt> and <tt>age</tt>.</p>
