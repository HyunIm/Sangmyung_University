              Version 7.1p2 (November 5th, 2008): </dt>
            
<dd>
              QueryResult distinguishes between "no results" and
              "before first result" states (thanks Bob Kirby). Fixed a
              slot-specific bug and a no-loop bug (thanks Neal Wyse.)
              Fixed a problem with salience evaluation in peered
              engines (thanks George Williamson).
            </dd>
            
<dt>
              Version 7.1p1 (August 6th, 2008): </dt>
            
<dd>
              Small documentation fixes; added Rete.setMemberChar()
              method; fix bug in overriding default slot values in
              extending templates.
              </dd>
            
<dt>
                Version 7.1 (July 8th, 2008): </dt>
            
<dd>
              Some small documentation fixes; avoid an erroneous
              error message (thanks Bob Kirby); a better error message
              for pretty-printing a Java function (thanks Wolfgang Laun);
            </dd>
            
<dt>
                Version 7.1RC1 (June 2nd, 2008): </dt>
            
<dd>
	      Exceptions include source file names. Exceptions from
	      "batch" include the line number in the batch file, not
	      the caller. ValueFactory is public and
	      documented. "&lt;&gt;" behaves properly for more than 2
	      arguments (thanks Henrique Lopes Cardoso). Added uniform
	      methods for removing all types of constructs. Jess can
	      understand that "&lt;Fact-6&gt;" is a reference to the
	      fact with ID 6, in many contexts. HashCodeComputer is
	      public. JessDE warns when rules, queries, deffunctions
	      are redefined. Modules can be declared
	      "auto-focus". "call" will invoke a static method on a
	      named class in preference to a method of
	      java.lang.String if the target is an
	      RU.SYMBOL. RU.valueToObject will convert a LIST to an
	      Object as an Object[]. Rete uses system property to find
	      scriptlib. Template properties (backchain-reactive,
	      slot-specific) are inherited. clear() doesn't touch
	      event handlers, mask, or watch state. Parser handles
	      dotted vars in direct LHS tests. "get" fetches slot values from
          Fact objects. "(read)" and "(explode$)" handle nested variables.

<dt>
                Version 7.1b3 (April 2nd, 2008): </dt>
            
<dd>
            Line numbers in JessDE problem markers are one-based
            (thanks Win Carus). Reject "if" without "then" in all
            cases (thanks Michael Atighetchi). JessDE understands
            Eclipse projects that store files outside the
            workspace. The "(add)" function respects logical
            dependencies (thanks Lorie Ingraham). Fixed a bug with
            slot-specific and multiple modifies (thanks Florian
            Fischer). The static constraint checker will
	    ignore variables as slot values (thanks Wolfgang Laun.)
            </dd>

            
<dt>
                Version 7.1b2 (February 20th, 2008): </dt>
            
<dd>
	      Added "continue" (thanks Win Carus). get/set delegate to
              get-member/set-member on failure. Fixed set-strategy
              bug (thanks Neal Wyse). FactIdValue doesn't cache fact
              id (thanks Art Griesser). no-loop is thread-specific
              (thanks Yixi Chen). Added Rete.createPeer() method
              (thanks John Adair.)
	    </dd>
            
<dt>
                Version 7.1b1 (November 16th, 2007): </dt>
            
<dd>
       
               Fix bug attempting to resolve blank variables (thanks
               Bob Kirby.) Optization: cull rule binding table at
               compile time.  Allow 'test' CE inside 'logical' (thanks
               Denis Berthier). Deprecate Activation.isInactive() (has
               returned only 'false' for several releases.) Fixed bug
               wherein activations of deleted rules could persist
               (thanks Florian Fischer). "batch" can accept a
               charset. Fix bug with "slot-specific" and "not"
               (Fischer.) Dot notation for Bean properties of Java objects.
               Added "Rete.hasActivations()". Fix concurrency issues with
               peered Retes during "clear()."

	      Fix agenda bug (thanks Brian Rogosky).
            </dd>
            
<dt>
                Version 7.1a3 (October 3rd, 2007): </dt>
            
<dd>
               Keyed storage bsaved/bloaded (thanks Henrique Lopes
               Cardoso.) Don't obfuscate ClassResearcher.Property in
               trial version (thanks Wolfgang Laun). DEFMODULE
               events. Dot notation in Java patterns. Fix bug in
               redefining templates which extend other templates. Fix
               logical bug (thanks Aaron Novstrup). Fix agenda bug
               (thanks Brian Rogosky.) Fix and/not bug (thanks Florian
               Fischer and Bob Kirby). Fold "test" CEs into preceding
               pattern. Translate many 'eq', 'neq' funcalls into direct
               matches.
            </dd>
            
<dt>
                Version 7.1a2 (July 19th, 2007): </dt>
            
<dd>
               Fix bug using "!=" and "&lt;&gt;" in compound infix
               expressions (thanks Richard Long.) Fix bug in
               run-query* with 'or' CE (thanks Robert Kirby.)
               Implement "allowed-values" slot qualifier. "return" at
               prompt now acts like "break" (thanks Wolfgang
               Laun). Lots of documentation fixes (Laun). Fixed a race
               with definstances in "reset". Faster startup: no AWT
               classes loaded by default. Fixed an issue with
               waitForActivations (thanks Chad Loder.) Fix an
               incremental reset bug with "not" (thanks Florian
               Fischer.) Fix bug in resolving redefined Userfunctions (thanks
               Henrique Lopes Cardoso). Queries work with peering
               (thanks Chad Loder.) Add Rete.listDeffunctions() method
               (Laun). "call" knows about lambdas.
            </dd>

            
<dt>
                Version 7.1a1 (May 14th, 2007): </dt>
            
<dd>
                Can pass the STRING "nil" to a Java method (thanks Win
                Carus). Added "elif" to "if" function. ValueFactory
                class with pooling for symbols. Fixed incremental
                reset bug (thanks Rand Waltzman). jess/RegexpMatch is
                Serializable (thanks Shyamal Pandya). Did a general sweep for
                concurrency issues. Fix JessML docs (thanks Henrique Lopes
                Cardoso.) Peering of Rete objects. Added "break" function.

            </dd>

            
<dt>
                Version 7.0p1 (December 21st, 2006): </dt>
            
<dd>
                New commands in JessDE: select construct, pretty-print
                construct. Portable Mac keybindings. "Java patterns"
                (infix test patterns) can use grouping via
                parentheses. Multiline comments and strings don't
                disturb JessDE formatting or damage repairer. JessDE
                Rete view shows all OR branches, and node colors in
                trial version (thanks Mark Proctor). "watch rules"
                output goes to watch router (thanks Helge Hartmann.)
                Repeated negated unifications in a multifield are kept
                (thanks Gary Riley).
            </dd>

             Fixed a race condition in module switching (thanks Scott
             Krasnigor). Fixed an issue with matching defglobals in
             "not" conditional elements (thanks Joshua
             Undesser). Fixed RuntimeException on parsing a bad rule
             (thanks James Lefeu).

             Lopez Cardoso). Fix Rete.removeUserfunction()
             (Cardoso). Add FilteringIterator, documentation, ByModule
             filter, fix (facts) documentation (thanks Christoph
             Bussler). Fix performance issue in Context. Manual
             includes "pricing engine" domain code. Fix agenda
             ordering issue (thanks Heinrich Flaig). ppdeftemplate
             doesn't print slots for from-class templates. Fix three

<dd>
              Fix NPE using defgobals with 'or' connectives (thanks
              Howard Greenblatt). Reject nested parens early (thanks
              Yuping He). backchain-reactive declaration works for
              ordered templates (He). Token.getTime() and
              Token.getTotalTime() are now public. Don't need to put
              jess.jar on build path of Jess projects. "Open file..."
              works. RuleExecutionSets in JSR-94 driver are cloned for
              each RuleSession. Fix problem debugging files starting
              with blank lines. save-facts-xml/load-facts for XML
              (thanks Stacy Lovell). New "remove" function retracts
              all facts from a given template. XMLPrinter can now be
              used programmatically. "batch" in JessDE uses classpath
              properly. Added package versioning. lowcase, upcase
              return symbol for symbol arguments. XML schema included.
              Various small JessML changes. Fix ClassCastException in
              jess.Multimap.remove() (thanks Neal Wyse) 'type' qualifier for
              multislots (Greenblatt). Better error message for wrong toplevel
              XML element. Add "as-list" function.

              Boolean comparison operators work on
              Comparables. Support for braces in editor. Enormous
              improvements in editor "content assist" features. Undo
              removes both characters of autoinserted
              parentheses. Added context help for completion
              proposals. Fixed bug in modifying multifield facts
              (thanks Brian Zhou). JessML includes docstrings for all
              constructs (thanks Erich Oliphant). JessML now has
              imperative features. 36% of application test suite now
              runs in XML mode. Can specify an XML file as argument on
              command line. Fix error switching to Debug Perspective.

<dd>
               Fix bug in (logical) when modifying working memory from
               nested scopes (thanks Yuri Gribov). Added "add"
               function. Added "Java patterns." Deprecated
               executeCommand() in favor of eval(). <i>Massive</i>
               manual rewrites. Another logical/slot-specific bug
               fixed (thanks Shan Ming Woo.) Rete member in
               ClassSource transient (thanks Jonathan Sewall.)
               Overloaded updateObject() accepting property name (for
               Lakshmi Vempati). Fix synchronization of "undefinstance
               *" (thanks Abdul Quddoos Khan). Slight change to "accumulate"
                semantics (thanks Shan Ming Woo.) Overloaded "add()"
               methods in ValueVector.

                Don't "wrap" external JessExceptions in another
                JessException. Fix a logical/slot-specific interaction
                (thanks Shan Ming Woo). QueryResult gives better error
                messages for undefined variable parameters or for
                calling getXXX() before next(). Pretty-print
                zero-length multislot patterns correctly (thanks
                Jonathan Sewall). (map) handles multi-argument
                functions (thanks Yuri Gribov.) (watch) accepts
                multiple arguments. Bug in handling multiple
                multifields in slot-specific templates fixed (thanks
                Howard Greenblatt). QueryResult has full
                Javadoc. Added "ppdefrule *". Static imports handle
                overloaded methods. Fixed incremental reset for
                accumulate (thanks Roger Studner). Defadvice for
                nested function calls (thanks Ivan Op de Beeck.)
                undeffacts function added. JessDE parses functions for
                rule salience values (Gribov). XMLPrinter handles "or"
                conditional element properly. Reparsing bug with
                "accumulate" in the JessDE fixed (thanks Jason
                Morris.) "modify" now once again modifies multiple
                slots simultaneously. "max" and "min" return their
                arguments using their original data types. Debugger
                now correctly steps though router I/O statements.

                Fix slot-specific behavior for "null" property names
                in change events (thanks Shan Ming Woo). Fix SAX parse
                error for facts with no slots (thanks Wang Dong.)
                Fixed definstance name resolution across modules
                (Woo). New "map", "filter", and "list" functions for
                functional programming. Run configurations are reused
                in Eclipse. Can pass command-line arguments from
                Eclipse Run dialog. Defglobals show up in JessDE
                debugger. Spaces in path names won't confuse jess.bat
                (thanks Eric Schubert.) Fix deadlock in debugger when
                stepping over (read) and (readline) calls (thanks Jim
                Goodwin.)  "Start suspended" checkbox in debugger. Can
                specify jess.Main alternate in launch
                configuration. Tiny font in manual navbar fixed. New
                URL for Jikes in manual. New "quick start" section in
                manual, and a new simplified engine API as described
                therein: mark(), resetToMark(), add(), addAll(),

              Continued work on manual and javadocs. JSR94 driver
              available in demo jar. (help) gives help on constructs
              and is generally more helpful. list-functions$ doesn't
              list static imports. Deprecate the term "external
              address" in favor of "Java object", and deprecate all
              names based on this term. Add the "auto" qualifier for
              definstance, and change the default behavior to
              "auto". Swing versions of Canvas,
              TextAreaWriter. Debugger handles spaces in path
              names. Reverse ill-considered "optimization" in NodeNot2

              Fix interactions between code folding and auto-paren
              insertion (thanks Howard Greenblatt). Format in editor
              no longer appends a blank line to document. Lots of work
              on the manual and Javadocs. Fix a memory leak in
              TokenTree (thanks Steven Goncalo.) min and max work with
              LONG (thanks Shan Ming Woo.) Static imports! Fix for
              accumulate bug (Woo, again.) Definstance uses
              template resolution procedure as assert (Woo). Fixed an
              erroneous report of variable used before definition
              (thanks Bill Robinson).

              JessDE editor has preference to turn on line
              numbering. Fixed another leak in (logical). Close
              "backdoor" for putting lists in single slots (thanks
              Timothy Redmond.) Better error messages for constructor
              failures. Per-slot logical dependencies. Defclass
              templates get proper slot types. Fix pretty-printing of
              slot types and error-reporting for non-symbolic slot
              types (thanks Howard Greenblatt.) XML representation for
              defclasses. All-new JSR94 driver. "Folding" in JessDE
              editor. Editor deals with bad build path (thanks Howard
              Greenblatt).  Defclass names now properly "modular."
              Fixed problem unifying negated variables in nested
              groups (thanks Neal Wyse.) Undefrule removes activations
              regardless of current module (Neal Wyse.) Editor doesn't
              warn about recursive deffunction calls. Public member
              variables as slots. "div" handles multiple arguments
              (thanks Shan Ming Woo.)

              Fix incorrect error message in set/get-member
              functions. () syntax for empty list. Fix bug in
              compiling logical dependencies on backward-chaining
              triggers (thanks Timothy Redmond). Fix JDK version
              detection (thanks Bob Hablutzel.) New functions: "++",
              "--", "for". Debugger can both "step into" and "step
              over" (thanks Mitch Christensen). "require" and
              "provide". Default values for multislots parsed better
              (thanks Travis Nelson.) "Toggle comment" works
              better. Can map keys to JessDE editor commands. Editor
              recognizes set-current-module.  Fix bug in JessDE editor
              autoedit strategy, inserting at end of all-comment
              buffer (Mitch Christensen.) Lots of new "quick fixes."
              Smarter completion processing. "Agenda" view in
              debugger. Source location always returns source files,
              never files in /bin (Mitch Christensen).

              New Rete network view in JessDE. Fixed problems
              inserting at end of document in JessDE editor. Improved
              autoformatting in JessDE editor. External Eclipse
              projects work fully. Runtime class loading errors
              reported as error markers. Improved content
              assist. Document change in "batch" behavior (thanks Jeff
              Pierce). Some better error messages. set-watch-router
              command (thanks G. Williams.) New "value object"
              facility; large speedups in Java-object-matching
              performance are possible. Slight improvement in
              auto-parenthesis insertion (thanks M. Christensen.)
              Added initial "quick fix" implementation to

              JessDE. JessDE can find Java classes in more
              places. JessDE reports warnings on bad arguments to more
              functions. Content assist works for functions called at
              top level.

              Siorpaes). Fix NPE in modify. Fixed "Not a Not a list"
              error messages (thanks Joseph Tappero). Added multiline
              comments (for Ross Judson.) Added -debug switch to
              jess.Main. jess.Main no longer stops on the first error
              in a file. Fixed extra-newline problem in reading
              erroneous input interactively (thanks Maxim
              Tretyak). Eclipse debugger now included, based on new
              debug mode in jess.Main. Fix overeager query analyser
              (thanks W. Robinson.) Vastly improved editor
              performance. Editor finds classes in other projects and
              outside workspace. No more duplicate "Source" menu in
              JessDE (thanks Jason Morris.) Editor checks
              load-function calls. Fixed NPE when modifying Fact with
              non-negative not in working memory (thanks Adam
              Velardo.) Fixed NPE when extending a nonexistent
              deftemplate (thanks Rodolfo Martin). "Run as..." in
              Eclipse. Better parsing of
              doubles. jess.Context.setVariable only sets values
              locally. Editor uses Rete import table to resolve classes.

              More documentation. Fixed spurious error reporting of
              variable use in defquery (William N. Robinson). Jess 7
              works under JDK 1.3 (Alan Moore). Parser clearly reports
              misused constructs (Mong-Thao La). JessDE editor
              responds to resource changes (Howard Greenblatt). JessDE
              editor uses project build path for class loading (Mitch
              Christensen). Functions that list things in a module
              tell you what module they've been applied to. Fixed bug
              in slot-specific (thanks Dan Malka). fact-slot-value
              calls Fact.getIcon first. Merge readline fix from

               forgiving about arguments to "modify". (thanks Chris
               Huang.) Folded in changes from 6.1p7. Report undefined
               variables used in predicate constraints (thanks Mitch
               Christensen.) Fixed backward chaining triggers inside
               logical CE (thanks Steffen Luypaert). Parser responds
               sooner to erroneous input. Slot names in "modify" and
               "duplicate" can be variables. Faster reflective method
               calls, especially for member functions of
               java.lang.String. Better pretty-printing. Help command.
               fact-slot-value moved from scriptlib to Java. "ordered"

                handling for Java objects with mutable
                hashCodes. 20-40% performance boost for Java object
                manipulation. "forall" conditional element
                added. "accumulate" conditional element added. XML

                static Rete.getEngine() method. When any fact, shadow or not,
                is modified, either from Jess, from the Java API, or from a
                Bean event, a single FACT | MODIFIED event will be
                generated. Many of the built-in package classes are no longer
                public. Added Rete.updateObject and (update). Added Rete.modify().
                Added Rete.watch(), unwatch(). (watch facts) reports modify again.
                max-background-rules declaration added to defquery.

                "synchronized" and "get-strategy" functions. Calling
                "set-strategy" now changes the default strategy for new
                modules. Fixed a deadlock in defquery (thanks Chad Loder.)
                Public interface "Test" renamed to "TestBase." Fixed bug in

                handle arbitrarily nested AND and NOT CEs in a new, simpler
                way; universal quantifiers are now handled correctly. Fixed a
                bug with the logical CE when adding new rules to a running
                system. Undefinstanced, nonserializable Beans now no longer

                values. Many methods in jess.Context now
                public. Rete.retract() now calls undefinstance() if
                needed. Rete.undefinstance() returns shadow fact. Matching
                against defglobal works (thanks Simon Hamilton.) (logical) bug

                nth$ returns nil instead of throwing exceptions (thanks Seung
                Lee.) Deffunction has public API for fetching arguments and
                actions (thanks Scott Kaplan, Henrik Eriksson). If
                pattern-matches during (modify) throws an exception, the
                modified fact no longer disappears from the fact-list (thanks
                Mihai Barbuceanu.) If pattern-matches during addDefrule throw,
                rule is still added to rulebase (thanks Mikael
                Rundqvist). Fixed rounding bug in format function (thanks Mike
                Isenberg). Fixed issue with variable renaming when an 'and' CE
                was nested in a 'not' CE (thanks Drew Van Duren). Can omit the
                functor 'call' even if the Java object is the return value of
                a function call. retract, assert, and duplicate will once
                again accept an integer as their first argument -- the fact-id
                function is no longer necessary (although it can still be
                used.) You can put pattern bindings inside of grouping
                CEs. (undefinstance *) now works as advertised (thanks Jason
                Smith). Remove "modify-n" rewrite optimization, so pattern
                binding to (or) CEs works.

                stack, etc., implemented. (clear) doesn't delete Java Userfunctions

                (thanks Matt Bishop). (rules), (facts), others, now in Java, not

                New pretty-print architecture which shows how things are actually
                represented; based on new Visitor interface. ppdefX functions now
                return, rather than print, their results.  show-jess-listeners works
                again. Simplify how negated patterns are parsed. JAR file not an
                executable JAR anymore. Fix Thread problem with runUntilHalt, deadlock
                in propertyChange (thanks Charles May.) deffunctions accepting only a
                wildcard can now be called with no arguments (thanks Thomas Gentsch.)
                No more erroneous undefined variable message (Gentsch.) The minus (-)
                function works if one or more arguments are atoms, just as the
                other binary math functions do (thanks Pau Ortega.) The first arg to

                greatly decreasing memory usage. Quit button removed from Console
                (thanks Andrew Marshall.) Calling a native function that returns a

                possible bug; a new version of FuzzyJess will be required to work with

                so you don't need to do it yourself anymore. Lots of refactoring --
                Rete now exports more useful functions, but delegates their
                implementations; for example, there are public defclass(),
                definstance(), and undefinstance() methods. A small bug in Tokenizer

                still needs refactoring and (and) and (or) won't work correctly inside
                of (not). waitForActivations() could block even if activations were
                available; now fixed (thanks Thomas Barnekow). Added some "LISP
                compatibility functions:" progn, apply. Fixed off-by-one error in
                line-numbers in error reports. Vastly improved efficiency of
                multifield matching (thanks to Sebastian Varges for noticing a problem
                with the old implementation.) Deactivate activations earlier in the

                (thanks to Osvaldo Pinali Doederlein for the idea.) Bob Orchard
                figured out how to get rid of the extra EOFs in jess.ConsolePanel.
                Console and ConsoleApplet can now read a file and continue, as they
                used to. Backwards chaining now more general; one goal can trigger
                multiple rules, both in parallel and in chains. ViewFunctions and
                ReflectFunctions moved into jess package, many more classes now
                package-private. jess.reflect package renamed jess.awt; TextReader,
                TextAreaWriter moved into it. "throw" command added (thanks Eric
                Eslinger).

<dd>
                Call removePropertyChangeListener on undefinstance (thanks to Dan
                Larner.) Added defadvice. Three buglets, thanks to Bob Orchard:
                defglobals can now refer to other Defglobals in their definitions;
                (bind) and (foreach) are now pickier about arguments; undefined
                variables now universally evaluate as 'nil'. Applet security problems
                fixed (thanks S.S. Ozsariyildiz). Problem with matching and otherwise
                dealing with zero-length multislots and array bean properties fixed;
                null array values are converted into zero-length arrays (thanks
                Miroslav Madecki.) (call) does much better error reporting. Passing
                Strings to functions accepting Objects now works (J. P. van
                Werkhoven.)

<dd>
                Token(Token) changes UPDATE to ADD. Hashcode used in TokenTree
                modifiable. (clear) now fully clears deffacts. Many general
                speedups. TokenTree hash factor can now be set globally and per-rule.
                Functional Accelerator class exists for math functions. (modify)
                funcalls print out correctly. get-var removed (no longer needed.)
                Nonsychronization error in jess.Retract.call() led to Corrupted
                Negcnt; fixed (reported by Dan Larner). Other corrupted negcnt error
                due to duplicated tokens fixed. definstances can be static or
                dynamic. jess.Pattern is public; several methods added or made public
                to support rule editors. Defrule.toString works for all cases. Console
                class now uses Main to do business. .jessrc file now named
                scriptlib.clp and found using Class.getResource(). (batch) can use
                getResource() to find scripts, so they can live in .jar files. Batch
                now an intrinsic. Rewrote some multifield functions to better handle
                JAVA_OBJECT objects; added hashCode() to jess.Value. (facts) and
                (rules) now in scriptlib, not Java. Much improved public interface for
                Deftemplate, Fact classes.

                All 16-bit (Reader/Writer) text I/O - some user code changes required.
                Serialization (crude version). Inheritance for deftemplates,
                defclasses. jess.Main reads $HOME/.jessrc at startup if it exists. No
                more ReteDisplay, Resetable, or Clearable interfaces: instead, use
                jess.JessListener and jess.JessEvent. (view) uses JessListener instead of
                Observer/Observable; rewritten to provide movable nodes, per-node
                debug code.  jess.reflect.JessListener class renamed to
                jess.reflect.JessAWTListener. Bean-itized many function names (name()
                -&gt; getName()), breaking lots of user code, I'm afraid. (run)
                returns number of rules fired. Ordered facts now stored as unordered
                with one multislot named __data. Backwards chaining added. Bload and
                Bsave added.

                Fixed redundant default-value processing, which was leading to odd
                problems with definstances with null slot values (thanks to
                S.S. Ozsariyildiz). Removed intern()s from Tokenizer (faster

                Fixed 'Corrupted negcnt' bug (thanks to Todd Bowers). (if ... then)
                function now throws an exception if atom 'then' is missing. Version string
                in 4.1 final was inadvertently left at 4.1b6. Added section to README
                explaining rule LHS semantics a bit better. Rete.findFactByID() is now
                public. Fix for very tricky 'phantom fact' problem reported by Steve
                Bucuvalas. Java method calls on Jess Strings now work for all Strings,
                not just alphanumeric ones. "animals" example modified to work with
                transitional gensym implementation.

                Allow named variables in (not) CEs as long as they're not used in
                subsequent CEs. Fix a bug that was causing (return) to not work if
                inside a (foreach) inside a deffunction. Recursive deffunctions now
                work again. Jess works around a bug in some versions of Java that was
                preventing the atom '-' from parsing. Rete.listDefglobals() no longer
                lists duplicates of redefined defglobals (Karl Mueller found this
                one.) ReteDisplay.fireRule() is now called as appropriate. Accessing
                pattern-binding variables on rule LHSs works again (Karl again.)
                (reset) wasn't clearing all activations (thanks Al Davis);
                fixed. Funcall.toString() puts parens around the ValueVector version.

                addUserfunction, addDeffunction, etc collapsed into one
                addUserfunction routine in Rete class; same with
                findUserfunction. RU.getAtom() and RU.putAtom are gone!
                Userfunction.name() now returns String. ControlStructure
                interface used to clean up handling of such things. ReteCompiler uses
                Hashtables of Bindings instead of int[][] for vartables. Added
                default-dynamic deftemplate slot qualifier. Added
                set-/get-reset-globals, and changed the default defglobal reset
                behaviour. Added dynamic rule salience. Removed arbitrary limit of 32
                slots for ordered facts and 32 tests per slot for all facts. "unique"
                CE (15-30% speed increase for many problems!) Various documentation
                improvements (many thanks to Win Carus.) Better error reporting
                (addContext() call in JessException.) Malformed calls to 'eval' or
                'build' or 'executeCommand' no longer go into an infinite loop on
                EOF. Added "store" and "fetch". Added "external-addressp". Rearranged
                Test1, Test2 classes into an inheritance hierarchy with a virtual
                doTest method, allowing for alternate implementations (undocumented
                java-test functionality included). Value class will do more type
                conversions automatically. Final multifield argument of a deffunction
                now acts as a wildcard, as in CLIPS (thanks David Young.)

                Problem with calling public methods of package-private classes from Jess
                fixed thanks to Lars Rasmusson's explanation. OutOfMemoryError
                while parsing file containing unbalanced open parens fixed. Line breaks
                in double-quoted strings no longer need to be (but can be) escaped. Two
                fixes thanks to Andreas Rasmusson: gensym* returns a symbol as
                documented, not a string; and a propertyChangeEvent for a bogus
                property no longer causes Jess to retract a definstance without
                updating it. Many of the synchronized methods in the Rete class
                no longer are synchronized; instead they use either synchronized blocks
                keyed to affected members or simply depend on the internal synchronization
                of Hashtables. read and readline explicitly act differently
                for console-like and file-like streams. ConsoleDisplay gets a
                Clear Window button.</dd>

                again properly return the result of last expression, not
                EOF. min, max take arbitrary # of
                arguments. implode$ now works; it apparently never really
                did. printout puts parens around multifields
                again. str-compare documentation
                corrected. undefinstance now removes the fact representing an
                object as well as deactivating matching. Wrote large regression test
                suite (not included in distribution). Bug in multiple simultaneous
                Rete.run() calls in separate threads fixed thanks to Andreas
                Rasmusson. Selectable conflict resolution strategies (only depth and
                breadth supported now) and user-definable strategies. The try
                command is added.</dd>

                fixed. Separate command-line, applet, and GUI console driver classes
                (Quiz* classes broken up, renamed to
                Console*). read and readline should work

                Extensive manual rewrite, adding lots of Java/Jess interoperation info.
                Allow standard CLIPS deffunction docstrings. Thanks to Jack Fitch, Dave
                Carlson and Alex Jacobson, property names for reflected Java Beans now
                use standard capitalization transform. Better error reporting, especially
                during parsing and from the command line. set and get
                renamed to set-member and get-member. set and
                get are now functions that read and write Bean
                properties. ppdefrule
                properly handles quoted strings in function calls. executeCommand
                and friends reuse a single parser. Thanks to Karl Mueller for
                Rete.retractString. Taught batch to read
                applet-based data files. eval now handles non-sexps. Better
                mechanism for synchronizing streams. QuizDisplay
                is an applet as well as an application. run accepts an argument,
                the maximum number of rules to fire. Fixed bug in modify when
                new slot value was a zero-length multifield. Fixed ReteCompiler
                bug where MTELN nodes were not consistently generated for zero-length
                multifield matches. Thanks to Sidney Bailin, fixed problem with accessing
                defglobals and variables bound to pattern indexes on rule LHSs. Added
                get-var function. Added
                undefinstance. modify and retract now
                handle definstance facts specially. Fixed some doPPPattern
                bugs (Dave Carlson again!).</dd>

                set, and get. Added JessListener and its subclasses.
                added engine. Changed printing of external-addresses to include
                Java class name. Changed parser to accept variable names as Funcall heads
                (call is substitued, resulting in a runtime error if call
                is not installed). and and or functions now accept any
                values as arguments, not only funcalls. Added foreach control
                structure. Command prompt doesn't print NIL return values. Fixed
                another not bug (thanks to Sidney Bailin). Added matching of Java
                objects on rule LHSs: definstance, defclass. TokenTree
                now uses sortcode % 101 as hash key, not the sortcode
                itself. All global classes moved into jess package. Jess
                class renamed Main.</dd>

                Cleaned up router/parser interactions. Jess will now read only one construct
                on a line of input (just like CLIPS). All Jess output now goes through
                WSTDOUT router, not through ReteDisplay.stdout(). Fixed
                bug whereby second and later references to subfields of multifields on
                the LHS of a rule would resolve to the whole multifield. modify
                can now properly handle multislots. format handles trailing spaces.
                Finally, parsing of integers: 2 is an RU.INTEGER, while
                2.0 is an RU.FLOAT. Added eval and
                list-function$.</dd>

                tokens). test CE. Return-value constraints. ppdefrule
                thanks to Rajaram Ganeshan. Blank variables in not CEs. system
                blocks by default. readline fixed. build supported. logic for
                predicate functions in Rete network now precisely the same as for CLIPS.
                QuizDisplay demo. while and if accept boolean
                variables. Implied returns from if and while functions.
                Added explode$. Added I/O routers: open, close.

                class finally removed in favor of separate implementation classes for intrinsics,
                leading to a modest speed increase. Documentation vastly expanded! Added
                catch for ArrayOutOfBoundsException in command-line interface;
                no more crash on wrong number of arguments. Broken evenp, oddp
                fixed. str-cat, sym-cat made more general. Broken sub-string
                fixed. Big switch in Node1 class replaced by separate classes,

<dd>
                Added the assert-string and batch commands. Two bug fixes
                in multislot code (thanks to Nancy Flaherty). Added undefrule
                and the ability to redefine rules. Added the system function,
                although it doesn't work very well under Java. Public function engine()
                in jess.Context class allows you to do fancier things in Userfunctions.
                Added the non-standard load-package and load-function
                functions. Many new contributed functions packaged with Jess for doing
                math, handling multifields, and other neat stuff thanks to Win Carus. Added
                time (1 second resolution).</dd>

            
<dt>
                Version 3.0</dt>

            
<dd>
                A few code changes to accomodate Microsoft's Java compiler; Jess now compiles
                unchanged with JVC thanks to Mike Finnegan. Added member$ multifield
                function. Added clear intrinsic thanks to Karl Mueller. Introduced
                a new way of handling not patterns which I think finally guarantees
                there are no more not-related bugs remaining! load-facts, which
                has been non-functional throughout the beta period, is working again. Documentation
                now explains unzipping and compiling a little better. Modified the way
                fact-id's are handled so that you can write (retract 3) to retract
                fact #3.</dd>

                Version 3.0b2</dt>

            
<dd>
                Lots of bug reports and improvement suggestions from the field - thanks
                folks! All the reported bugs in the multifield implementation, and some
                residual odd behavior in the not CE, have been fixed. The exit
                command has been added. A command prompt has been added. The #
                character can now be used in symbols. The access levels on some methods
                in the Rete class have been opened up; Rete is no longer
                final. nth$ is now 1-based, as it is in CLIPS. The if
                and while constructs now fire on not FALSE instead of
                TRUE. The str-index function has been fixed and added.
                Probably a few more things I'm forgetting here. Thanks for the input. Particular
                thanks to Nancy Flaherty, Joszef Toth, Karl Mueller, Duane Steward, and
                Michelle Dunn for reporting bugs fixed in this version; sorry if I left
                anyone out.</dd>

                Version 3.0b1</dt>

                First public release of Jess 3.0.</dd>

            
<dt>
                Version 3.0a3</dt>

            
<dd>
                UserPackage interface. Lots of new example UserFunctions for multifields,
                string, and predicates.</dd>

            
<dt>
                Version 3.0a2</dt>

            
<dd>
                Multislots! Also important bug fix: under certain circumstances, the Rete
                network compilation could fail 1) if (not()) CEs occurred on the
                LHS of a rule, 2) new variables were introduced in that rule's patterns
                listed after the (not()) CEs, and 3) these latter variables were
                tested (i.e., in a predicate constraint) on the LHS of the rule.</dd>

            
<dt>
                Version 3.0a1</dt>

            
<dd>
                Incremental reset. Watch activations. gc() in LostDisplay,
                NullDisplay. Multifields! All the Rete engine classes are now
                in a package named jess. Many classes and methods that should
                not be manipulated by clients are now package-private.</dd>

            
<dt>
                Version 2.2.1</dt>

            
<dd>
                Ken Bertapelle found another bug, which has been squashed, in the pattern
                network.</dd>

            
<dt>
                Version 2.2</dt>

            
<dd>
                Jess 2.2 adds a few new function calls (load-facts, save-facts)
                and fixes a serious bug (thanks to Ken Bertapelle for pointing it out!)
                which caused Jess to crash when predicate constraints were used in a certain
                way. Another bug fix corrected the fact that retract only retracted
                the first of a list of facts. Jess used to give a truly inscrutable error
                message if a variable was first used in a not CE (a syntax error); the
                current error message is much easier to understand. I also clarified a
                few points in the documentation.</dd>

            
<dt>
                Version 2.1</dt>

            
<dd>
                Jess 2.1 is *much* faster than version 2.0. The Monkey example runs in
                about half the time as under Jess 2.0, and for some inputs, the speed has
                increased by an order of magnitude! This is probably the last big speed
                increase I'll get. For Java/Rete weenies, this speed increase came from
                banishing the use of java.lang.Vector in Tokens and in two-input node memories.
                Jess is now within a believable interpreted Java/C++ speed ratio range
                of about 30:1. Jess 2.1 now includes rule salience. It also implements
                a few additional intrinsic functions: gensym*, mod, readline.
                Jess 2.1 fixes a bug in the way predicate constraints were parsed under
                some conditions by Jess 2.0. The parser now reports line numbers when it
                encounters an error.</dd>

            
<dt>
                Version 2.0</dt>

            
<dd>
                Jess 2.0 is intrinsically about 30% faster than version 1.0. The internal
                data structures changed quite a bit. The Rete network now shares nodes
                in the Join network instead of just in the pattern network. The current
                data structures should allow for continued improvement.</dd>
