<h2>15.
        The javax.rules API</h2>


<a name="introduction">
<h3>15.1. Introduction</h3>
</a>

<p>
<tt>javax.rules</tt>, also known as JSR-94, is a Java runtime api
   for rule engines. It provides a very simple model of interaction
   with the rule engine itself, and a somewhat more involved mechanism
   for administering sets of rules. </p>


<p>The <tt>javax.rules</tt> API does <i>not</i> define a rule language
   of its own, but rather just an API for working with vendor-specific
   rule languages. In theory, you can write a program to the
   <tt>javax.rules</tt> API, and use it with different rule engines
   without modifying or recompiling the Java code. This would be
   accomplished by changing parameters in a configuration file, and
   swapping out one vendor-specific rule definition file for
   another. In practice, the <tt>javax.rules</tt> API fails to
   expose many of the interesting features of Jess directly, so this
   implementation provides a "hook" that will allow you to add
   Jess-specific code to take advantage of these features.</p>


<p>Finally, note that the reference implementation of
   <tt>javax.rules</tt> took the form of a driver for Jess. This
   driver was defined in the package <tt>org.jcp.jsr94.jess</tt> and
   used its own XML "wrapper" format for Jess language code. Jess 7
   now includes its own <tt>javax.rules</tt> driver, defined in the
   package <tt>jess.jsr94</tt>. This new driver supports code written
   in the Jess language itself as well as <a href="xml.html">JessML</a>; the reference implementation's
   "wrapper" format is not supported. Please don't use the reference
   implementation driver; use the new <tt>jess.jsr94</tt> driver
   instead.</p>



<a name="using">
<h3>15.2. Using javax.rules</h3>
</a>
   
<p>Using <tt>javax.rules</tt> to work with Jess is a two-stage
   process. In the first stage, you create and register a <i>rule
   execution set,</i> which is basically an instance of
   <tt>jess.Rete</tt> with templates, rules, and other necessary code
   already loaded. In the second stage, you retrieve the rule
   execution set from the registrar, load Java objects into it, and
   execute the rules.</p>

   
<a name="registering">
<h4>15.2.1. Registering a RuleExecutionSet</h4>
</a>
    
<p>
       Our first example shows how to create a rule execution set from a
       file of Jess code and how to register it with <tt>javax.rules</tt>.
       You could use an XML file instead of a Jess file; the code would not change.
       Exception handling has been left out for brevity. Most of the methods
       in the <tt>javax.rules</tt> API throw both a subclass of
       <tt>javax.rules.RuleException</tt> and <tt>java.rmi.RemoteException.</tt>
   
</p>
   
<p>
       Typically, a <tt>RuleExecutionSet</tt> is created once and executed multiple times. The intention
       behind the <tt>javax.rules</tt> design is that <tt>RuleExecutionSet</tt>s would be created using an
       app server's configuration tools, and then used by application code.
   </p>


<div class="javacode">
<pre>

import javax.rules.*;
import javax.rules.admin.*;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.io.FileReader;

public class ExJSR94Register {
  public static final String URI = "rules://test-rules";
  public static final String RULE_SERVICE_PROVIDER = "jess.jsr94";

  public static void main(String[] argv) throws Exception {
    // Load the rule service provider.
    // Loading this class will automatically register this
    // provider with the provider manager.
    Class.forName(RULE_SERVICE_PROVIDER + ".RuleServiceProviderImpl");

    // Get the rule service provider from the provider manager.
    RuleServiceProvider serviceProvider =
        RuleServiceProviderManager.getRuleServiceProvider(RULE_SERVICE_PROVIDER);

    // get the RuleAdministrator
    RuleAdministrator ruleAdministrator =
        serviceProvider.getRuleAdministrator();

    // get an input stream to a ruleset
    FileReader reader = new FileReader("rules.clp");

    // parse the ruleset
    try {
        // "properties" holds vendor-specific information
        // Jess doesn't use this parameter for these methods
        HashMap properties = new HashMap();

        // Create the RuleExecutionSet
        RuleExecutionSet executionSet =
            ruleAdministrator.getLocalRuleExecutionSetProvider(properties).
            createRuleExecutionSet(reader, properties);

        // register the RuleExecutionSet
        ruleAdministrator.registerRuleExecutionSet(URI,
                                                   executionSet, properties);

    } finally {
        reader.close();
    }
  }
}

</pre>
</div>

    

    
<a name="using">
<h4>15.2.2. Using a RuleExecutionSet</h4>
</a>
    
<p>Now that we have registered a <tt>RuleExecutionSet</tt>, we can use it to run the rules.
    For this example, let's use the following trivial rule file <tt>rules.clp</tt>:
    </p>


<div class="jesscode">

<pre>
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(defrule foo
=&gt;
(add (new String "Hello, World!")))</pre>

</div>

    
<p>When executed, this rule will fire and add a single String to working memory. Here is the Java
    code to retrieve and execute the <tt>RuleExecutionSet:</tt>
</p>


<div class="javacode">
<pre>

import javax.rules.*;
import javax.rules.admin.*;
import java.util.*;

public class ExExecuteJSR94 {
  public static final String URI = "rules://test-rules";
  public static final String RULE_SERVICE_PROVIDER = "jess.jsr94";

  public static void main(String[] argv) throws Exception {
    // Get the rule service provider from the provider manager.
    RuleServiceProvider serviceProvider =
        RuleServiceProviderManager.getRuleServiceProvider(RULE_SERVICE_PROVIDER);

    // Get a RuleRuntime
    RuleRuntime runtime = serviceProvider.getRuleRuntime();

    // Create a StatelessRuleSession
    StatelessRuleSession session = (StatelessRuleSession)
        runtime.createRuleSession(URI, new HashMap(),
                                  RuleRuntime.STATELESS_SESSION_TYPE);

    // Create a input list.
    List input = new ArrayList();

    // Execute the rules
    List results = session.executeRules(input);

    // Release the session.
    session.release();

    // Report the results
    System.out.println(results);
  }
}
<b>C:\&gt;</b> java ExExecuteJSR94
</pre>
</div>


<p>When you run this program, if all goes well it will print "[Hello, World!]," displaying the single object
in working memory.</p>


<a name="objects">
<h4>15.2.3. Working with Java Objects</h4>
</a>

<p>
When we called <tt>executeRules()</tt> in the example above, we passed an empty <tt>List</tt> as an argument.
You can instead pass in a <tt>List</tt> populated with Java objects. Jess will, for each object:</p>


<ol>

<li>Determine the name of the class, without the package name.</li>

<li>Ensure that a template has been created under that name, or create a new one.</li>

<li>Add that object to working memory  under that class name.</li>

</ol>


<p>Jess will then execute the rules. You therefore should write your
rules assuming that the objects will be filed in working memory under
their class name with the package prefix removed. Note that your rule
file should define appropriate templates for any objects actually
matched by your rules using <a href="constructs.html#deftemplate"><tt>deftemplate</tt></a> or <a href="functions.html#defclass"><tt>defclass</tt></a>, or the rules won't parse.
</p>


<p>
In this release, there's no way to control how these templates will be
placed into modules, and there's no way to express Jess's concept of
inheritance. These features will be added in a later release.
</p>




<a name="more">
<h4>15.2.4. Going Further</h4>
</a>

<p>
There's a lot more to the <tt>javax.rules</tt> API than we've covered here. In particular, besides
stateless rule sessions, there are stateful rule sessions that let you add and remove objects over time.
Furthermore, there are many different ways to create a RuleExecutionSet. Besides creating one from a
local file, they can be created from XML DOM trees and directly from existing <tt>jess.Rete</tt> objects.
Interested readers are directed to <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr094/index.html">the specification itself</a>
for more information until more information is added to this manual.
