<h2>2.
        The JessDE Developer's Environment</h2>

    
<p>Jess 7 includes an Eclipse-based development environment. There
        is an editor, a debugger, and a Rete network viewer. More
        components (a rule browser and other tools) will be included
        in future releases.</p>


<a name="installing">
<h3>2.1. Installing the JessDE</h3>
</a>
  
<p>The Jess Developer's Environment (JessDE) is supplied as a set of
  plugins for the popular open-source IDE Eclipse; in particular,
  these are plugins for Eclipse version 3.1 or later.  Note that the
  JessDE works only with the full "Eclipse SDK" -- the smaller
  "Platform Runtime Binary" is insufficient.</p>

  
<p>To install the JessDE, simply exit Eclipse, unzip all the files
  from Jess71p2/eclipse into the top-level Eclipse
  installation directory. Confirm that a directory named
  "plugins/gov.sandia.jess_7.1.0" exists under your Eclipse
  installation directory, and then restart Eclipse.  </p>

  
<blockquote>
  
<b>IMPORTANT!</b> If you're updating
  from a previous version of the JessDE, you must launch Eclipse
  with the "-clean" command-line switch to force it to update the
  information it caches regarding the JessDE plugins. If you don't do
  this, many of the JessDE's options may be disabled. You only need
  to do this once after the installation.
  </blockquote>


<a name="verifying_install">
<h4>2.1.1. Verifying your installation</h4>
</a>


<p>Under the "Help" menu, choose "about Eclipse SDK". There will
be a button with the Jess logo on it on the main "About Eclipse SDK"
window. Press "Plug-in Details". If the JessDE is installed
properly, you'll find three or four Jess-related plugins in the
list -- in my copy of Eclipse, they appear near the bottom.</p>


<p>Then create a Java project using the "New Project" wizard. Create a
new file in that project, and name it "hello.clp". It should open in
the Jess editor, which has a little silver ball with a red "J" as its
icon. Enter some Jess code, like</p>


<div class="example">
<pre>
(printout t "Hello, World" crlf)
</pre>
</div>


<p>
You should see appropriate syntax highlighting. If so,
congratulations, everything is working! Read on for more information
about the other features of the JessDE.
</p>



<a name="install_details">
<h4>2.1.2. A few more details</h4>
</a>
  
<p>
     The JessDE editor creates problem markers to point out syntax
     errors and warnings in your Jess documents. You most likely want
     to have these markers show up in the Eclipse "Problems" view,
     although they might not show up by default. After installing the
     JessDE and restarting Eclipse, in the Problems view, click on the
     "Filters" icon in the title bar, and check the box labelled "Jess
     Problem" (if it's not already checked.) Your Problems view should
     now display Jess errors and warnings.
  </p>


<p>To use the Rete Network View, you'll need to have the Eclipse Graph
      Editing Framework (GEF) installed. You can get the GEF from the
      Eclipse project page <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef/">here</a>, or install it
      through Eclipse's built-in update manager. Then to display this
      view, find it under the "Jess Debugger" group in Eclipse's "Show
      view" dialog. Then when the cursor is inside a rule in a Jess
      editor window, the Rete Network View will show the compiled
      network for that rule.
</p>





<a name="using">
<h3>2.2. Using the JessDE</h3>
</a>

<a name="using.editor">
<h4>2.2.1. The Jess language editor</h4>
</a>

<p>The JessDE editor can edit ".clp" files. By default, any file you create
with the extension "clp" will be opened using the JessDE
editor. There's no separate Jess perspective, or Jess project type; we
expect that most people will use the JessDE tools to write the Jess
components of a hybrid Jess/Java application, and so the tools expect
to be used on files in a Java project. The JessDE uses your Java
          project's class path to resolve Java class names used in
          Jess language code -- i.e., in a call to the
            <a href="functions.html#defclass"><tt>defclass</tt></a> function.
</p>


<p>The editor has all the features you'd expect from a modern programmer's editor.

<dl>
    
<dt>
<b>Syntax coloring you can customize.</b>
</dt>

    
<dd>You can change the default colors using the "Jess Editor" tab
    of the Eclipse global preferences dialog. </dd>

    
<dt>
<b>Content assistant supplies deftemplate, slot and function
    names.</b>
</dt>

    
<dd>You can invoke Eclipse's "Content Assist" feature in many
    different places within the JessDE editor; JessDE will make it
    much easier to enter Jess code. Press Alt-'/' while typing to
    produce a list of choices. </dd>

    
<dt>
<b>"Quick fix" assistant can repair code automatically</b>
</dt>

    
<dd>This feature is bound to Ctrl-1 by default. Quick fix
    currently knows how to define undefined deftemplates, and add new
    slots to existing deftemplates (if they're defined in the same
    file.) More to come!</dd>

    
<dt>
<b>Real-time error checking with markers and error
    highlighting</b>
</dt>

    
<dd>Errors and warnings are highlighted as you type</dd>

    
<dt>
<b>Automatic code formatting</b>
</dt>

    
<dd>Code is indented as you type. You can also choose "Format"
    from the "Source" menu to format an entire buffer.</dd>

    
<dt>
<b>Fast navigation using outline view</b>
</dt>

    
<dd>The Eclipse outline view lists all the constructs defined in a
    buffer; you can click on any one of them to quickly navigate to
    it. </dd>

    
<dt>
<b>Parenthesis matching and auto-insertion</b>
</dt>

    
<dd>When you type a '(' or '"' character, JessDE insert the
    matching character as well. When your cursor is next to a
    parenthesis, JessDE shows you the matching parenthesis. </dd>

    
<dt>
<b>Online help for Jess functions and constructs via "hovers"</b>
</dt>

    
<dd>You have quick access to the Jess manual description of every
    function and construct type.</dd>

    
<dt>
<b>Help hovers for deftemplates and deffunctions</b>
</dt>

    
<dd>If you hold your mouse over the name of a deftemplate or
    deffunction, anywhere in the code, JessDE will show a "tooltip"
    containing information about that template or function.</dd>

    
<dt>
<b>Run and Debug commands for Jess programs</b>
</dt>

    
<dd>You can run or debug a Jess program using the normal Eclipse
    "Run..."  menu or by right clicking on Navigator items or in the
    edit window.</dd>

<a name="dependencies">
<h4>2.2.2. Dependencies among files</h4>
</a>

<p>
Sometimes one <tt>*.clp</tt> file depends on code in some other
<tt>*.clp</tt> file having been read first; for example,
<tt>rules.clp</tt> might need the definitions in
<tt>templates.clp</tt>. Without these definitions, <tt>rules.clp</tt>
will appear to have syntax errors. To deal with this, you can use the
<a href="functions.html#require*"><tt>require*</tt></a> function. "require*" lets you
explicitly declare these dependencies.
</p>

<p>
If a file <tt>rules.clp</tt> depends on Jess commands being executed
from Java, you can deal with this by creating a special file just for
this purpose (you might call it <tt>ruledepends.clp</tt>). That special
file can contain whatever declarations are needed to make
<tt>rule.clp</tt> parse properly in the editor. If you add
"<tt>(require* ruledepends)</tt>" to <tt>rules.clp</tt>, then this extra file
will be parsed only if it's present, as it will be during
          development. When you deploy the code, you can simply not
          deploy <tt>ruledepends.clp</tt>, and allow
        <tt>rules.clp</tt> to get its declarations from Java code.
</p>

<p>
The "require" mechanism replaces the "Source dependencies" property
sheet from earlier versions of JessDE, which is no longer supported.
</p>



<a name="using.reteview">
<h4>2.2.3. The Rete Network view</h4>
</a>

<p>You can instantly see a graphical representation of the <a href="rete.html">Rete</a> network derived from any rule
        using the JessDE's "Rete Network View". When this view is open
        (you can open it using the "Windows | View | Other..." dialog
        in Eclipse) it will display the Rete network for the rule that
        the editor caret is in. You can use this to see, in real time,
        how modifying a rule changes the Rete network. The graph
        layout is far superior to that you get from the Jess "view"
        command -- there are no overlapping or crossing lines, and the
        height of each "column" can vary.</p>


<a name="using.debugger">
<h4>2.2.4. The Jess debugger</h4>
</a>
        The JessDE debugger lets you debug a Jess program defined in a
        .clp file. It has all the features you'd expect from a
        graphical debugger: you can suspend and resume a program, or
        step through it. When the program is stopped, the contents of
        the execution stack are displayed, and you can examine the
        variables defined in each stack frame. Selecting a stack frame
        also navigates to the source code being executed.

        You can also set (or clear) breakpoints in any .clp file by
        right-clicking in the ruler on the left-hand edge of the
        editor window. Breakpoints can be set only on functions
        (either built-in or user defined), so you can't break on a
        <a href="constructs.html#defrule"><tt>defrule</tt></a> or <a href="constructs.html#deftemplate"><tt>deftemplate</tt></a> construct. You can, however, break
        on a function call on the left or right-hand side of a rule.
