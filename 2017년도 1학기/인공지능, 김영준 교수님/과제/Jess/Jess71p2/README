Congratulations on downloading a distribution of Jess. You'll find a
file lib/jess.jar in this distribution -- that's Jess. We've included
two scripts that you can run to get a Jess command prompt: one for
Windows, and one for UNIX. They're both in the bin/ directory. Run the
one that's appropriate for your system, and you should see something
like this

   C:\Jess71p2> bin\jess.bat

   Jess Version 7.1p2 11/5/08
   
   Jess>

That's the Jess prompt. Try evaluating a prefix math expression like
"(+ 2 2)". Don't forget those parentheses!

Now get started by having a look at the manual: open docs/index.html
in your favorite web browser. As this is a development version of
Jess, be sure to checkout docs/release_notes.html for late-breaking
news.

The directory "examples/jess" contains some tiny example programs
written in the Jess rule language, and "examples/xml" contains some of
the same examples written in XML. The Jess manual includes
instructions on using these samples.
