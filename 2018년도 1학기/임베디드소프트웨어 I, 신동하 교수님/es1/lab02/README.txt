lab objectives
==============

- ARM assembly programming.
- The function "main" programmed in C calls the functions "multi" and
  "fact" programmed in ARM assembly.
- How to handle arguments and return value in functions programmed in
  ARM assembly.
- The prototypes of two assembly functions "fact" and "multi" is
  follows:

  unsigned int multi(unsigned int i, unsigned int j);
  unsigned int fact(unsigned int n);

Note: The function "multi" can not use "mul" instruction!
